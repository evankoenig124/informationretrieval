        "Body": "<p>Assume you have a jigsaw puzzle that is also a tessellation.  This means every piece has an identical shape and can be assembled into a 2D pattern that fills the plane with no gaps.  Such a jigsaw puzzle might look like this:</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/70mOL.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/70mOL.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p><p>Or, by a weak definition, even this:</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QUJtK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QUJtK.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p><p>Now most people don’t recognize that triangle grid to be a “jigsaw puzzle” because none of the pieces are interlocking.  Before anybody starts trying to create a definition for what geometries constitute “interlocking”, let’s take a look at a third example:</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6e91S.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6e91S.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p><p>You will first note that any two adjacent pieces do not actually lock together, they can be simply slid together or apart.  Now look at the red “fault line” I drew in the overall pattern.  If I try to separate the puzzle along that line, you will notice that pieces zig-zag enough where they are locked together and won’t move apart.  You can, however, still pull this puzzle apart.</p><p>The teaser question:</p><blockquote><p>How can you pull apart the above puzzle?  The pieces must stay on the plane (or table, I suppose) and for sake of simplicity, let's just assume there is one piece in the center and it has 6 adjacent neighbors</p></blockquote><p>But the real question is:</p><blockquote><p>Can you design a <strong>single shape</strong> that satisfies the following:</p><p>It can be <strong>tessellated</strong> (cover an infinite plane with no gaps)</p><p>Any two adjacent pieces are <strong>not interlocking</strong> by themselves</p><p>By assembling some number of pieces together (beyond two), the pieces become interlocking and thus <strong>cannot be slid apart</strong> in any way</p></blockquote><p>This is intended to be a real-life question, but the math needs to check out too.</p><p>ALSO: I used CAD software when I designed this problem.  I'm assuming most of you don't have that, so I'll try and help people out by providing feedback.  More than once I thought I had a good idea that didn't pan out so don't feel bad if I tell you you're wrong.  Have fun!</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p>This question has been answered by <strong>@Florian F</strong> but there are other approaches that could solve it.  I came up with two and neither were like that one.  I'll maybe post mine eventually but for now anybody can keep trying.  (I've added the open-ended tag)</p></blockquote>",

        "Body": "<h2>Preface</h2><p>After your last mishap with a <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/18448/murdered-down-the-rabbit-hole-a-long-logic-puzzle\">heap full of rabbits</a>, you got sick of being lied to. Isn't life just so much easier when you can conclusively tell if someone's been telling the truth or not? For that very reason, you went out and bought a <strong>lie detector</strong>. It works, too! Now, when interrogating suspects, it's as easy as asking the right questions, and getting the answers you need.</p><p>Unfortunately, no silly rabbits to hide behind this time. An honest-to-god human has been murdered, and it's up to you to figure out, as they say, \"whodunit\".</p><h2>Backstory</h2><p>This town is small. <em>Real</em> small. Not a lot going on here, at all. You wander up to the sheriff's office and slam open the doors. The sheriff looks up at you from his desk.</p><p>\"Detective. It's about time. I've been waitin' for ya.\" He shuffles up some papers on his desk and slides them to the side. \"This one's a big one. You should sit.\" </p><p>Normally, you're belligerent whenever you get the chance, but this time your feet hurt, so you gladly sit in the chair across from him. Continuing on, he tells you, \"Hugh G. Pokitz has been murdered.\" He pauses, waiting for a reaction, then shrugs. \"Right, I forgot you don't live here. Pokitz is the beneficiary of this entire town. He's the reason any of this exists. He's -- well, he <em>was</em> -- the richest man this side of the Poughipasaw.\" </p><p>You nod in understanding. \"Tell me the facts.\"</p><p>The sheriff begins to talk, but you pause him. Reaching into your briefcase, you pull out a small metal device and strap it onto his arm. He looks at you, puzzled. \"It's a lie detector,\" you explain. \"Just gotta make sure the thing is calibrated.\" </p><p>He nods back, then continues. \"The doctor did a preliminary autopsy and discovered foxglove in Pokitz's system. It's been determined that the foxglove was the cause of his death. Here's the thing about this particular strain of foxglove -- it wilts within two days of not being stored properly, which the mansion does not have the means to do. It also has to be administered orally, or else it won't kill. So the poison got into the mansion within the last two days, and Pokitz somehow got tricked into eating it.\"</p><p>\"Who would have motive?\" You ask, dreading the answer.</p><p>The sheriff sighs. \"Basically everyone. No one liked him. He abused his employees, extorted the shopkeepers, and catcalled all the women. It's no secret that his wife, Mai, was only with him for his money. And he liked it that way.\" With a pause, he muses, \"A better question would be, who <em>didn't</em> have motive?\"</p><p>You chuckle, then remember your here on business and steel yourself. \"So, to recap:\"</p><h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>The poison made it into the mansion <em>within the last two days.</em></li><li>The poison must have been <em>administered orally.</em></li><li>Basically <em>everyone is a suspect</em>, since he was hated by all.</li></ul><p>You finish jotting down your notes. The sheriff sees you close your notebook and makes an offer. \"I've brought in the, as I can see it, only possible suspects -- would you like to meet them?\"</p><p>You grin a devilish grin. \"Oh, I'd <em>love</em> to.\"</p><h2>Interrogations</h2><p>Snatching your lie detector, you're escorted down the hall to a holding cell. \"I traced the murder out in my head,\" the sheriff said. \"The poison must have been obtained from the apothecary. She's the only one anywhere near here who would have access to it. It was either bought in the store, or delivered in the mail, and I'm not sure which. Hopefully you and your lie detector can trace the poison straight from the apothecary to the victim's mouth.\"</p><p>You stop in front of a glass window. Behind the window sit eight people. The sheriff details them for you. \"From left to right, we have: <strong>Mai Pokitz</strong>, the <strong>Pokitz's butler</strong>, the <strong>Pokitz's chef</strong>, the <strong>apothecary</strong>, the <strong>apothecary's apprentice</strong>, the <strong>postmaster</strong>, the <strong>Pokitz Mansion gate guard</strong>, and the <strong>Pokitz's maid.</strong>\"</p><p>He walks back to the door you came through. \"I'll leave you to it.\" You smile and walk through the door to the holding cell.</p><blockquote>  <p>Suspect: Mai Pokitz  <hr />      \"Why aren't you crying?\" You sneer at Mai as you approach. She shrugs. \"I hated that guy, and I'm still rich. So 'boo-hoo', I guess, but it's no sweat off my back.\" She grins. \"I didn't kill him, though.\"<br>      Slapping the lie detector onto her wrist, you growl, \"Say that again.\" She winces. \"Ow! What is that?\" You smile. \"It's a lie detector! Now I'll know for sure that everything you're saying is true.\" She scowls, then repeats herself. \"Okay, fine. <strong>I didn't kill my husband.</strong>\" You eagerly wait for the lie detector to go off, but it doesn't.<br>      You scowl. \"Fine. Who had access to his food between its preparation and its consumption?\" She ponders for a moment. \"Um...<strong>only the chef and the butler</strong> had access to his food. No one else could have touched it.<br>      Sounds like you've narrowed it down. \"Thank you for your time.\"  </p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote>  <p>Suspect: Pokitz's Chef  <hr />      \"I've got it all figured out, chef,\" you say as you attach the lie detector to his wrist. \"You went out and bought the poison from the apothecary. Then you came back, and you poisoned Hugh's meal, because he mistreated you. Admit it, and I'll read you your rights.\"<br>      The chef looks shocked. \"No, sir! It's true, I've been mistreated, but due to that, <strong>I haven't left the mansion in a week!</strong> I haven't even been out of the kitchen, except to relieve myself.\"<br>      <em>Well, there goes that idea,</em> you think. \"Fine. Did you see the butler do anything odd with the food before he served it?\" The chef responded, \"No, not at all. He simply <strong>took the tray as he always does</strong> and carried it out of the kitchen.\"<br>      Looks like the butler is your murderer. \"Thank you for your time.\"  </p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote>  <p>Suspect: Pokitz's Butler  <hr />      \"Okay, butler, the gambit's up.\" You attach the lie detector to his wrist. \"I know you poisoned Hugh's food between the kitchen and the dining room. He abused you, and you were sick of it. Admit it, you filth.\"<br>      The butler simply sighs. \"No, monsieur, I surely didn't. In fact, I <strong>didn't touch anything but the tray</strong> between the kitchen and the dining room.\" You scowl at the lie detector, but he's telling the truth.<br>      \"Did anything seem suspicious to you?\" You inquire. The butler shakes his head. \"No, monsieur. In fact, I <strong>taste the meal for poison</strong> every night, as I did last night, so if the meal was poisoned, surely I would be dead now too.\"<br>      Back to square one. \"Thank you for your time.\"  </p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote>  <p>Suspect: Apothecary  <hr />      Time to at least figure out where the poison came from. With lie detector attached, you accuse the apothecary. \"You sold the poison to this woman, didn't you? Shame on you, facilitating a murder like that.\"<br>      \"How DARE you accuse me!\" The apothecary jabs back. \"No, I did not sell poison to this woman. In fact, <strong>I've never once before made a transaction with Mai Pokitz, nor anyone else in this holding cell</strong>. And that includes gifts and donations of any kind.\"<br>      You sigh. \"Fine then. Who else could have accessed your store?\" The apothecary jingles her keys. \"These are the keys to my store. Only <strong>myself and my apprentice</strong> have copies.\"<br>      Looks like you've got an apprentice to interrogate. \"Thank you for your time.\"  </p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote>  <p>Suspect: Apothecary's Apprentice  <hr />      You circle your next suspect, as he shakes nervously in front of you. You gingerly attach the lie detector to his wrist. \"Something wrong, boy? You nervous?\"<br>      \"N-no,\" he stammers. The lie detector lets out a shrill beep. \"Good to know that still works,\" you say. \"Don't worry, boy. If you aren't guilty, I'm sure everything's going to go fine for you.\" He gulps.<br>      \"Now admit it,\" you continue. \"You took the foxglove from the cupboard and sold it to this woman, didn't you?\" He shakes his head, and stammers, \"Only <strong>my boss has keys to the cabinet</strong> where the foxglove is kept. She says it's too dangerous for me.\"<br>      You frown. Another dead end. \"Thank you for your time.\"  </p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote>  <p>Suspect: Postmaster  <hr />      <em>If the package wasn't bought in the store, it must have been delivered</em>, you reason. Scowling, you snap the lie detector to the postmaster's wrist. \"I hear all the mail in the town, comes through you. Do I hear the truth?\"<br>      The postmaster nods. \"You do, sir. <strong>I handle all the mail for the entire town</strong>. If something was mailed, I would have seen it. And it's illegal to mail hazardous substances in this town. <strong>I check all the packages</strong> myself in case someone is breaking the law.\"<br>      You grin. Maybe you're finally getting somewhere. \"And did you see a package from the apothecary to this mansion?\" To your dismay, the postmaster simply shakes his head. \"No, sir. There was <strong>no package from the apothecary delivered to the mansion</strong>.\"<br>      You groan. \"Thank you for your time.\"  </p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote>  <p>Suspect: Pokitz Mansion gate guard  <hr />      You peer into the guard's eyes as you attach the lie detector to his wrist. \"Tell me who left and who entered the mansion in the last two days.\"<br>      The guard stands firm. \"Sir, <strong>no one has left or entered the mansion in the last two days</strong>. Three days, even. Not since Master Pokitz's last trip to market.\" You frown. <em>It must have been delivery then.</em><br>      \"Tell me, what do you know about the post delivered here?\" The guard continues to stand firm. \"I <strong>check all of the packages</strong> delivered to the mansion. It's my duty. <strong>If there was poison, I would have seen it</strong>.\"<br>      You slump your shoulders in defeat. \"Thank you for your time.\"  </p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote>  <p>Suspect: Pokitz's Maid  <hr />      You circle around on the maid, and attach the lie detector to her wrist. \"I'm told you handle all of the mail once it makes it past the front gate.\"<br>      She nods eagerly. \"Yes, sir, I <strong>handle all of the mail</strong> once it gets within the walls of the mansion.\" You sneer. \"And did you see anything suspicious over the last couple of days?\"<br>      She thinks for a moment, then shakes her head. \"No, sir. I <strong>didn't see anything that struck me as suspicious</strong> in the mail over the last three days.\" Again, your lie detector stays silent.<br>      Though you should be frustrated upon reaching another dead end, you instead smile. \"Thank you for your time.\"  </p></blockquote><hr /><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>You leave the holding cell, and find the sheriff waiting for you on the other side of the door. \"See? They're just a dead end,\" he admits in defeat. </p><p>You chuckle. \"Perhaps to you, pal. Perhaps to you. You've got a lot of truth-tellers in your town, which is a nice change of pace for me. But if you just listen to what everyone has to say, you'll see the <em>real</em> truth through the cracks.\" The sheriff looks at you, puzzled, but you just beckon for him to follow you.</p><p>\"Come on in, and let me show you justice at work. And let me borrow those handcuffs. We're gonna need 'em.\"</p><hr><p><strong><em>Who murdered Hugh G. Pokitz?</em></strong></p>",

He will not know the day of the hanging  until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon that day.</p>    <p>Having reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion  that he will escape from the hanging. His reasoning is in several  parts. He begins by concluding that the \"surprise hanging\" can't be on  Friday, as if he hasn't been hanged by Thursday, there is only one day  left - and so it won't be a surprise if he's hanged on Friday. Since  the judge's sentence stipulated that the hanging would be a surprise  to him, he concludes it cannot occur on Friday.</p>    <p>He then reasons that the surprise hanging cannot be on Thursday  either, because Friday has already been eliminated and if he hasn't  been hanged by Wednesday night, the hanging must occur on Thursday,  making a Thursday hanging not a surprise either. By similar reasoning  he concludes that the hanging can also not occur on Wednesday, Tuesday  or Monday. Joyfully he retires to his cell confident that the hanging  will not occur at all.</p>    <p>The next week, the executioner knocks on the prisoner's door at noon  on Wednesday — which, despite all the above, was an utter surprise to  him. Everything the judge said came true.</p></blockquote><p>From this I ask:</p><ol><li>How is it that despite the prisoner's sound logic, the judge is correct just the same?</li><li>Assuming the prisoner is a logician, is it even possible for the judge to be wrong?</li></ol>",

Unlike verbal cryptic clues, where the definition must occur at the beginning or end of the clue, the definition of a cryptic rebus can appear anywhere. It can even appear misleadingly integrated in or around the subsidiary indicator. (Perhaps it can even lend positional relations to the subsidiary indicator!)  Part of the fun of these puzzles is the thrill the solver gets upon discovering where exactly to “split” the clue into its components.</p><p>Also as with purely verbal cryptic clues, there is an exception to the rule that all clues consist of a definition and a subsidiary indicator. So-called double (or triple) rebuses comprise multiple rebuses, each one of which might yield a definition which points to the answer (as in standard cryptic double definitions); alternatively, one (or two) might yield a definition while the other directly yields the answer.</p><p>Here's your first set:</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/frCwU.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/frCwU.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p><p><sub>*I don't own any of the images from which I drew in making these puzzles.

The aliens give each abductee either a purple hat or a green hat. The 10 are lined up in a single file line, each facing forward, such that the last person can see the remaining 9's hats, the second to last person can see the remaining 8's hats and so on. No one can see his or her own hat.</p><p>The aliens then proceed, starting from the last person, to ask each of the abductees what the color of their hat is. If they guess correctly, they and the 10% of the human population they represent survives; if not, the opposite happens.</p><p>Assuming the abductees are given a chance to develop a strategy before they are lined up and questioned: what is the optimal strategy they can utilize (i.e. the one with the highest expected number of survivals)?</p><p>During the questioning, the abductees are not allowed to say <em>anything</em> besides their guess for the color of their hat when it is their turn.</p></blockquote><hr /><p><strong>Hint:</strong></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> The optimal strategy will always ensure 9 survivals, and will have a 50% chance of the 10th survival.</p></blockquote>",

You groan in disappointment. </p><p>The host explains that no doors are going to be revealed or opened prematurely, unlike the classic Monty Hall problem. Instead, you are given the choice of keeping the door you picked, or switching to the other two doors. If you stay, and the car is not behind your door, you lose. If it is, you win. If you switch, and the car is behind one of the two other doors, you win. It can be behind either one. If it was behind the first door you picked, you lose.</p><p>Suddenly you feel confident again. You realize that just like in the classic Monty Hall, your chances of winning the car if you switch are 2/3: you now get two doors instead of one. You tell the host you would like to switch to the two doors.</p><p>The host then asks you to reconsider, explaining that your chances aren't quite as good as you thought. The odds of a single door hiding a goat are 2/3, since two of the three doors hide a goat. Then, multiplying these together (for two doors) yields a probability of 4/9 that both of your two doors contain goats, yielding you a 5/9 chance of winning the car. The host grins as you realize your anticipated 2/3 odds have shrunk slightly, but you still decide to switch to the two doors. After all, 5/9 is still better than 1/3.</p><p>As you leave, goat leashes in hand, it still bothers you that your initial intuitive guess seemed to have been proven wrong by the host. You console yourself with the fact that you won both goats. Who ever needed a lawn mower, anyhow?</p><p><strong>What is your true probability of winning if you switch to the two doors?

Or you can roll the big die if you need one die roll - just add up the results of the three dice inside and calculate: $sum $% $6+1$.</p><p>But here is the <strong>question</strong>: Can you find an easy way to calculate from the 3 dice inside one roll of the big die a fair result of a 2 dice roll?</p><p>Clarification: We want (3,6) and (4,5) to be different results, i.e. it's not enough to get a fair sum of two dice. But (3,6) and (6,3) can be the same result.</p><p>You are not allowed to re-roll the dice or paint numbers on the outside of the big die. You may not discard the die which is closest to the top left corner of the table or anything like that, you must determine the result from only the 3 values of the small dice.</p><p><strong>The order of the three little dice should not matter.</strong> That is, whatever result you assign to $(1,4,5)$ should also be the same result as the one for $(4,1,5)$, and $(5,4,1)$, and all other permutations.</p>",

I suggest writing stuff down...)</strong></p><p>It's now the year 2150, and you're one of the few people who didn't leave earth twenty years ago. Why? A deadly disease overtook the planet, and you happen to have immunity. There are now less than ten million people on the planet - the rest have either died, or left on a voyage to find a new planet to colonize.</p><p>Being the workaholic detective that you are, you haven't taken a vacation in years, and your boss has demanded that you use your vacation days or lose them - You decide to go on a cruise trip to relax a bit. Approaching the cruise liner, you see the steward waiting at the boardwalk. You seem to be the only passenger there. Taking a quick glance at the boat, you notice that the boat is very old, but still kept quite nicely. It looks just like the ones made in 2009.</p><p>Walking up to the steward, you notice his name tag; <code>Chang</code>, it says. He's dressed nicely, pen in one hand, hologram-board in the other. As soon as you stop in front of him, he starts speaking, \"Welcome aboard the C.C.L RuhRoh! You have the great honor of being on her last voyage. This time, we will be traveling for 15 days, making no stops until we reach Australia. This will be a one way trip, and you will be flown back here from Australia at the end of this trip. May I see your ticket, good sir?\"</p><p>The cheerful tone of Chang really brought your spirits up. \"Sure thing,\" you respond, and you hand him your ticket. \"Where are all the other passengers?\" you ask.</p><p>Chang takes a quick look at his hologram-board, and responds, \"They're already all aboard. Our passenger count for this trip totals at 15, including.\"</p><p>Only 15 passengers? Shrugging, you think, <em>Well, it's an older ship, after all.</em> \"Oh, alright. I notice that this ship seems to be of an older design. Was it refurbished?\" </p><p>\"You noticed? This was the Seabourne Odyssey from 2009! Not very many people know that. However, all we really did was change the name and give it a paint job. Oh, we added some updates to the balconies. There are now separators spaced on it to provide each room with it's own personal balcony. They're still just as wide as before, great for a breath of fresh air - in fact, in our larger rooms near the front, the balconies have been slightly extended to allow a bit more walking room. We updated the engine as well - the ship now runs nuclear, and everything is AI operated. As a matter of fact, we only have access to the areas that were previously available to the public. Even I can't get into the engine room if I wanted to, so believe me, it's very safe. Luckily for us, the ship hasn't been changed enough for us to create a new deck plan. Here's a copy for you to reference while you are here.\"</p><p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nQhZj.jpg\" alt=\"Floorplan of the Cruise Ship\"></p><p><strong>(To get a better view of the floorplan, drag the picture into a new tab - it's a lot bigger than you think it is)</strong></p><p>Chang smiles, and leads you inside. \"I will take you to the other passengers - right now, they're getting to know each other on Deck 7, at the Seabourn Square. I suggest you do the same, you'll be with these people for the next two weeks. The ship will leave in approximately 1 hour.\"  \"And which room do I have?\" \"You're on Deck 8, room 830. I'll take your luggage up. Have a nice day, sir.\" With that, you have reached Seabourn Square, and Chang heads off to put away your belongings. Turning towards the square, you head in, looking at everyone out of habit.  Here's what you notice;</p><ul><li><p>There is a married couple (ring seen on fingers) talking to another male, mid 30s, well built, groomed, and good looking</p></li><li><p>There are 3 30-40 year old males at the coffee bar, in leather jackets, bald, beer gut; you instantly can tell that they're part of a biker gang</p></li><li><p>There are 2 25-30 year old males at one of the tables, socializing with someone who seems to be in his 50s.</p></li><li><p>There is another couple, very rich (evident of the bling they're wearing, and the rediculously massive diamond ring on the wife's finger). They seem to be shopping at the Seabourn Shop with a girl in her 20s. That girl is dressed nicely, but not expensively enough to associate her with the couple.</p></li><li><p>There's a man sleeping in one of the chairs, and a teenager sleeping in a different chair. The teenager is very well dressed, and his shades seem very expensive. The man is well groomed, and well built - he seems to be a very fit man.</p></li></ul><p>Not wanting to wake up the sleeping passengers, you head towards the males at the coffee bar, and take a seat beside them. After chatting with them a bit, you confirm that they indeed are part of a biker gang. Their names are Jack, Jerome, and Julian. Talking with them, they seem to be heavy gamblers, but very kind people. They tell you that the only reason they're in a biker gang is because it helps to deter potential trouble from the streets - \"muggers are less likely to attack if you're part of a gang,\" they say.</p><p>Now that you've made friends with them, you head off to the next group. You notice that the rich couple in the shop is still shopping, and the husband is carrying more and more stuff. It's almost as if he's buying anything his wife asks for. You move to the tables, and initiate a conversation with the three males there. Talking a bit with the older male reveals that he is a mathematics professor who goes by Dr. Brofonomo at the I.I.S (International institute of Schooling).</p><p>\"What about the two of you?\" you ask. \"What are your names, and what do you do?\"</p><p>\"Well, the department calls us the WTF partners. That's cus we grew up in the streets, and we don't remember our real names anymore. My name is Double You. My partner here is Tee Eff. See, together, we make DoubleYouTeeEff!\"</p><p>\"Ah, but what do you do?\"</p><p>\"If we said we were cops, would you believe it?\"</p><p>\"I don't know, I'd have to see some sort of proof...\"</p><p>\"How about our pieces?\" they said rather loudly. They pull back their blazers and you see that each of them is equipped with the standard issue P-139 plasma pistol. It's a superb weapon, and has an effective range of 150 meters. Police versions come equipped with a thermal scope, and the weapon is strong enough to blast through 3 or 4 layers of wall before dissipating. It's hard enough to find one of them in the black market, let alone two, so it's definitive proof that they're cops. You chat a bit more and discover that all three of them are really big gamblers, and judging by the way the cops act, they seem prone to violence (And honestly, unfit to be cops). You disregard that, however, and move away from this group, determined to make the most out of your night.</p><p>A glance over at the shop confirms your earlier suspicions. The wife is definitely just picking out whatever she wants, and the husband is buying and carrying everything. Feeling a bit of pity, you walk over and decide to help the poor man out. \"Hi there, that looks heavy. Can I help you?\"</p><p>As he hands you some bags, he says \"Thank you good sir. My name is George, how are you doing this fine day? Excited for this trip? I sure am!\" Unable to contain himself, he whispers to you,\"I have a fetish for neglect play, and my wife promised that she wou-\" His wife interrupts him. She isn't wearing a lot of makeup, and it looks like she's in her mid 20's. She points to an expensive antique necklace, priced at about 5 times your yearly salary. Without a second thought, the husband whips out his wallet. You instantly notice that it has a diamond card in it, which is only available to the richest of the rich. Proceeding to pay with it, you glance around, and notice that the wife is in a very deep discussion with the other girl. You ask for her name (The girl), to which you receive \"Carol\". A bit of chatting reveals that Carol's family all recently passed away in an accident. She went on this trip and brought her families ashes with her so that they could have some \"Quality Family time, y'know?\" She's a lot more cheery than most people who've just lost all the family they had left... A little too cheery. You reach out to shake her hand, but she gives you a look of disgust and turns back to the wife. Reluctant to interact with her anymore than necessary, you return to conversation with George. He points out his son, Max, who is the younger person sleeping in the chair that you noticed earlier, and mentions that his wife is named Giselle. After a bit more small talk, you leave the group.</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, you prepare to move to the next group. Socializing isn't easy, but the night is almost over. Looking around again, you notice that the fit man who was sleeping earlier is now with the couple that was talking to the young man at the tables. Those are the only people you still don't know, so you move over and join the conversation.</p><p>Here are the results of your talk with them:</p><ul><li><p>The fit man happens to be an exceptional gymnast from Africa (Olympic level), named !Peleh. He seems to be a very smart man, albiet his eyes keep wandering back towards the same spot - Giselle's left hand.</p></li><li><p>The younger guy, Kevin, is a seasoned playboy/pickup artist. The way he talks and walks and the subtle hints he keeps dropping towards the wife in the couple makes it clear to you.</p></li><li><p>The husband, Luke, isn't very bright. It's clear to the outsiders that Kevin is hitting on his wife, Leia, but he doesn't seem to notice at all. Leia is clearly miffed that Luke isn't noticing, and probably hasn't noticed all night.</p></li></ul><p>As the night comes to a close, you make a mental note of each person(s) room keys.</p><pre><code>You: Deck 8, 830Luke and Leia: Deck 7, 724Kevin: Deck 7, 726George, Giselle: Deck 7, 700Max: Deck 7, 701Carol: Deck 7, 702Jack: Deck 10, 1016Jerome: Deck 10, 1018Julian: Deck 10, 1020Double You: Deck 5, 536Tee Eff: Deck 5, 534!Peleh: Deck 8, 800Dr. Brofonomo: Deck 5, 533Chang: Deck 10, 1025</code></pre><p>Headed off to your room, you decide to get a good nights sleep.</p><p>For the next 3 days of the trip, nothing really happens. In fact it's quite relaxing.</p><p>It's now the 4th day of the trip. You decide to head down and see what everyone is up to, but when you get to Deck 5, you hear yelling and arguing from the direction of the Casino. Soon, you realize that Tee Eff and Double You have been gambling with Dr. Brofonomo as well as Jack, Jerome, and Julian. The two cops are accusing Dr. Brofonomo of counting cards, but Dr. Brofonomo denies it.</p><p>\"How else are you winning almost all the time?\" demands Double You, \"You MUST be cheating!\"</p><p>\"I insist,\" Dr. Brofonomo says, \"that I am NOT cheating. Just because I can make use of probability more effectively than you two dimwits doesn't mean that I'm cheating.\"</p><p>The argument goes on, and you don't want to be a part of it, so you quickly leave the scene. Stepping outside, you see Kevin and Leia in the pool. They seem to be having a good time. You turn back, reluctant to disturb them. As you head up to Deck 7, you spot Chang relaxing with Giselle and Carol at the coffee bar. Engaging in a bit of idle chit chat, they tell you that George and Max are sleeping in today, and are still in their rooms. Giselle seems to be getting really close to Carol, but the two of them don't seem to mind sharing personal space. As you keep watch over the conversation, you notice that Carol also seems to display disgust towards Chang. Since it's starting to get a bit uncomfortable, you and Chang leave after a little bit, and the two of you decide to take a walk on deck seven.</p><p>As you pass by Max's room, you notice that Max's door is slightly ajar. The two of you look inside, and notice that he's passed out, dead drunk with his face in the toilet, and it reeks of vomit. Reluctant to stay, the two of you quickly leave the scene.</p><p>\"It's getting a bit late now,\" said Chang. You look at your watch, and notice that it's already 7pm.</p><p>\"Yea, I think I'm going to hit the hay for the night\" you respond. \"It was really nice talking with you!\" With that, the two of you separate ways and you go back to sleep.</p><p>A shriek at 11am shocks everyone on the boat. It seems to have originated from deck 5, and you rush down to take a look. Upon entry of the scene, you notice that there are two dead bodies in the hallway - Double You and Tee Eff. Chang is crouched over, shivering in complete shock against the wall. As the other people start arriving, looks of fear and murmurs start going around. Deciding to take charge, you quickly examine the bodies and give an announcement.</p><p>\"To the best of my knowledge, the two of them were killed together, by the same shots from their own guns - to which I can't seem to find. They're both gone... \" Livor Mortis has not started to set in yet, but Rigor Mortis has completely set in. The bodies are disfigured from multiple plasma shots, and their hands are tied together by their own belts. There's are two shattered cups on the floor, and the liquid spilling out of it seems to be red wine, but you catch a hint of black market tranquilizer - a specific type you have dealt with before. To the best of your knowledge, you remember that the drug is most effective when delivered through ingestion, and it comes in a liquid form. It's strong, and takes effect in seconds. It's also ludicrously hard to get, unless you have connections, or you're rich. You quickly look at who has assembled in the hallway, and you notice that the math professor is missing. \"Where's Dr.Brofonomo??\" you ask. Nobody knows, so you quickly open his door to find him dead in his room as well - hole in the chest by a well placed plasma shot. As you examine the holey corpse, you notice that both Rigor Mortis and Livor Mortis have set in completely.</p><p>The people that are gathered are starting to feel more and more disturbed. Who could have committed these ghastly murders? \"Is everyone here?\" you ask.</p><p>From the middle of the crowd, Jack exclaims, \"George and Max aren't here, and Luke is missing as well!\"</p><p>Immediately, everyone rushes to deck 7, where George and Luke's rooms are.</p><p>Luke's room is closest, so you quickly try the door. It's locked, and you kick it down when Chang informs you that only the person with a key can unlock hallway door. You find that he's dead, but his body is still warm - he must have only died recently. Luke died of suffocation. You notice a bottle of sleeping pills on the nightstand, labeled for Leia.</p><p>The next room you rush into is Max's - the door is still in the slightly open, but it seems to have been moved a bit. You find Max dead in the bathroom, his belt around his hands, the remains of his head still in the toilet. Death by plasma shot to the back of the head, and by the looks of it, several shots. You find that Rigor Mortis has only started to set in for him, but no Livor Mortis.</p><p>Leaving the scene, fearing the worst, you head out of Max's room and head to Georges room, only to find that the door is locked.</p><p>\"George has the only key!\" exclaims Giselle.</p><p>Without a second thought, you kick down the door. You find him dead on the bed, a victim of plasma shots as well. His face is disfigured, the remains of a blindfold on the pillow, and you see excessive damage to his torso area, almost as if his murderer was committed with <strong>a lot</strong> of hate. You also find that his hands have been bound together with his belt. The room key is on the nightstand. A quick scan with your detective watch shows theat there are only one set of finger prints on the card - Georges. This only gets weirder by the minute. At the sight of her dead husband, Giselle breaks down and starts crying. You've never seen anyone as emotionally unstable, and Carol starts to comfort her, patting her back, reassuring her and whatnot. It seems that the situation has been handled here, until you realize that something is off about the room. It doesn't nearly feel as rich as it should, considering the monetary status of the family. You ask Giselle to take a look around, and she mentions that some of the jewelry that she had brought with her was missing.</p><p>\"I had put out the jewelry on the cabinet and nightstand when I got here, but it was gone a couple days ago - I thought George packed them away, but now I can't find them anywhere!\"</p><p>As you turn back to take a last look at George, you see that he's got a \"rocket in his pocket\".</p><p>As the situation settles down, you start questioning the events and the people around you.</p><p>You start with Giselle, since she's clearly unstable, and you thought it'd be a good idea to get it over with quickly. Boy was it ever a bad idea. She's so unstable that you can't even get a properly pronounced word out of her, so you move on to Carol.</p><p>\"Where were you all night?\"</p><p>\"In my room, alone. You can check the playlist on my TV. It's been playing since last night and still haven't stopped yet.\"</p><p>You move onto Leia. \"Where were you?\"</p><p>\"I was sleeping last night, and then this morning I was with Kevin since 8 o'clock - he treated me to breakfast, what a gentleman.\"</p><p>Kevin seemed slightly confused for a moment, but then he says, \"Yea, we had breakfast together. When the scream happened, we both rushed over.\" He looks like he just woke up from a really nice long sleep.</p><p>\"Can you tell me why you have a bottle of sleeping pills, Leia?\"</p><p>\"I don't sleep well on boats, so I had them prescribed to me on this trip.\"</p><p>You look at Jack, Jerome and Julian, and before you can say a word they say \"It wasn't us, we were playing cards last night in our room, we just got up...\" They 3 of them yawn in sequence, and you notice that they're unshaven and they have bed hair.</p><p>You turn to !Peleh, and ask where he had been. \"Well, I was asleep alone in my room last night. I had an early start this morning, and Chang and I went for a morning run around the boat.\"</p><p>Chang nods, agreeing with him. Chang confirms that after he left you he went straight to his room to try and sleep, but he was kept up by the loud card players across the hall. He mentions that he had woken up early this morning in order to run with !Peleh, which tells you that !Peleh wasn't lying about the run.</p><p>You look around, and try to make some sense of the situation. 6 murders have been committed on this trip. It can't possibly get any worse. That is, until you find out that after scouring the entire ship you can't find the two missing plasma guns. You mutter to yourself, \"They must've been thrown into the ocean... we're on a damn boat, after all, the perfect way to get rid of a weapon...\"</p><h1>The question: Can you figure out who committed the murders, how, and why?</h1><h2>Bonus: Who stole the jewelry, and how?</h2><p>Note: Everything required to solve this completely is provided.

The drink in question is in addition to any drinks served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner (or whatever terms you use for regular meals). There are no hospitals in Hell, that I know of, so you can safely count that out of your potential answers.</p><p>Okay, to add to the riddle to help it not be too \"broad\" (I hope that term isn't being used to disparage poor Mrs. Dunham), let me say this:</p><p><strong>Mrs. Dunham is a bit used to warmer climates and has to have her drink imported because it's not as popular in Hell as it was in her hometown.</strong></p><p><strong>The three times of the day are directly linked to the drink, for very old reasons</strong></p><p><strong>The drink in question is much more popular in this southern state where it is made</strong></p>",

But this time, all the numbers must be <strong>different prime numbers</strong>. In addition, the $8$ sums ($3$ horizontal, $3$ vertical and $2$ diagonal) must not only be <strong>different prime numbers</strong> among themselves, but also be different from the $9$ numbers in the grid. In other words, $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_9, S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_8$ must be <strong>all different prime numbers</strong>.</p><p>I suppose there are infinitely many solutions, so the challenge is to minimize the sum $S_1 + S_2 + \\dots + S_8$.

Each of the numbers from 1 to 1000 occurs on exactly one coffin and on exactly one locket.</p></li>  <li><p>Count Dracula puts the lockets into the coffins, so that every coffin contains exactly one locket. Van Helsing observes this, and knows exactly which locket is in which coffin.</p></li>  <li><p>Now it is Van Helsing's turn:  Van Helsing may (but does not have to) pick a pair of coffins and switch the lockets in these two coffins. Dracula observes the action of Van Helsing.</p></li>  <li><p>Van Helsing now leaves the crypt through the back door. Jonathan Harker (who has gained no additional knowledge over the choices of Dracula and Van Helsing in the first three steps) enters the crypt.</p></li>  <li><p>Count Dracula chooses an integer $N$ with $1\\le N\\le1000$, and announces $N$ to Jonathan.</p></li>  <li><p>Jonathan is allowed to perform 500 search steps of the following form: Jonathan chooses a coffin, opens it, and checks whether the locket in this coffin carries the number $N$.</p></li>  <li><ul>  <li>If Jonathan Harker finds the locket with number $N$ during his 500 search steps, then he and Van Helsing have won the game.

        "Body": "<p>As so often happens in fairy tales, there once was a king who had an intractable problem, one that even his wisest advisers could not solve. After many years of frustration, the exasperated king eventually declared that any who could solve his dilemma would earn his favor and join his royal court.</p><p>And as so often happens in these tales, these decrees eventually reached the ears of an clever commoner named Jack. Jack and his two brothers, Kevin (strong as an ox and nearly as bright) and Lewis (simple-minded but generous) set out, and against all odds found a solution to the kings dilemma.</p><p>Unfortunately, as happens too often in these tales, the king had second thoughts about his promises after his crisis was resolved. As mere commoners, Jack and his brothers would ill-suit the Kings royal court, thus he schemed to cheat the brothers out of their reward.He claimed that what he <em>actually</em> said was that the people who solved his dilemma would come to live at the castle, but not necessarily as nobility... </p><p>In this vein, he has gathered nine people from around the castle, nobility, but also commoners and servants; and the brothers can choose three of the presented people and take their places at the castle.</p><p>The king allows one question to be asked to each person present, but aware of Jacks sharp wit, prevents him from asking any of the questions.</p><p>Kevin and Lewis query the nine people, but being much less bright than their brother they fail to ask the most useful questions; and receive the less-than-helpful statements below:</p><ul><li><strong>Andrew</strong>: “I am a higher rank than Edward”</li><li><strong>Bernard</strong>: “Ivan is a noble”</li><li><strong>Charlie</strong>: “Andrew is a lower rank than me”</li><li><strong>David</strong>: “Charlie is not the same rank as me”</li><li><strong>Edward</strong>: “I am not the same rank as Bernard”</li><li><strong>Frederick</strong>: “George is not a servant”</li><li><strong>George</strong>: “That's right, I'm not a servant”</li><li><strong>Harold</strong>: “Frederick told me he is a servant”</li><li><strong>Ivan</strong>: “Harold is a commoner”</li></ul><p>Despite this, clever Jack believes he can still best the king, and elevate himself and his brothers to nobility. He quickly deduces the following facts about the people gathered before him:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Despite his disinclination to actually grant his promised reward, the king wants to atleast appear fair.</strong> <br/>Thus there must be at least three nobles amongstthe people presented.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nobles would fear to lose their own position to a commoner, butwould find amusement in the idea of their peers losing theirs.</strong> <br/>Assuch they would lie about themselves, but tell the truth aboutanyone else in the castle, including other nobles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Commoners would have nothing to gain or lose, but would be jealousof their countrymen being elevated.</strong> <br/>Thus they will lie about noblesto prevent Jack picking them, but otherwise tell the truth aboutthemselves and others.</p></li><li><p><strong>Servants would grasp this opportunity to escape their life ofservitude, and do anything to be picked.</strong> <br/>Thus they will lie aboutthemselves and anyone of higher rank than themselves to make theirposition sound better; though they tell the truth about otherservants, who present no competition.</p></li></ol><p>Note that these rules are subjective, and not necessarily consistent; It’s hard for liars to keep their stories straight! </p><p>Thus:</p><ul><li>A noble asked if he is the same rank as a servant would say yes, ashe lies about himself.</li><li>The same noble asked if the servant is the same rank as him would sayno, as he tells the truth about servants.</li></ul><p>From this, which three people of the nine presented should Jack choose so that he and his brothers become nobility?</p><hr><p><em>(Clarifications moved up from the comments)</em></p><p>Ok, sorry does seem to be more uncertainty here than expected; none of it intended to add complications. </p><p><strong>1 -</strong> To confirm what people have inferred, the ranks at the castle go Noble > Commoner > Servant. There are no intended \"ranks within ranks\", eg every noble is the same rank as every other noble. </p><p>I don't think it matters, but FWIW Jack and his brothers are considered commoners. </p><p><strong>2 -</strong> All statements are made with the truth values above, even between individuals presented. Thus \"X told me he is a Y\" is true only if X could tell Jack he is a Y. </p><p>The truth value of the second order statement is only intended to be about whether X truly did say Y, modified by whether or not the speaker of the second order statement lies about people of X's rank. </p><p>The intention was not to create a lie from whole cloth (X said Y is a lie because X never said Y nor anything like it). </p><p>I have spent 15 minutes trying to put my intentions around this clause into clear language, and am still pretty sure I failed. In retrospect this means I should have avoided that sentence type. Live and learn I guess...</p><p><strong>3 -</strong> My intended syntax and phrasing for determining who the subject of a statement is (in lieu of looking up grammar and syntax etc) is that <strong>a sentence is always about the first person mentioned in it</strong>, eg: 'I am better than X' is a sentence about oneself, and will be true or false based on whether one lies about themselves; 'X is better than I am' is a sentence about X (even though it refers to ones self), and is true or false depending whether one lies about people of X's rank.</p><p>This seems natural to me, but may not be standard (or even technically correct) - and is probably hell for non-native English speakers.

But it is right to obey traffic signs and be nice to people.</p><p>Sometimes she picks up things she finds, but I don't worry. Usually it just gets left down on the ground where she found it. Plus, anything she's holding (aside from her phone, which she would never let go of and always holds in one hand [kids!]), she might simply put it right down (or throw it right up, haha!), or even exchange it with something else she picked up! She'd even put it down just to pet a dog (she's crazy about dogs). She always bends down to pet them, and she never picks them up, but you better believe she'd never do anything to hurt one either. Of course, when it comes down to people, she's nice, too.</p><p>Luckily she's old enough to read and she obeys written rules (and the laws of physics) because if it was left up to her, she'd just go around doing what she wants.</p><p>Since she's so good, sometimes I let her go right on down to the ice cream store, but sometimes a little while after that she just throws it right up.</p><p>And she always listens to me, too. I told her to go right home after she left the playground (and she did). So, what did she do on the way home that got her into trouble?</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RsdVI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RsdVI.png\" alt=\"The adventure home\"></a></p><p>I'm not sure about the tag for this one, so feel free to let me know if it fits another category.</p><p>Hint:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> My daughter will touch each grid point exactly once. The text contains many rules about which directions she might (or might not go) based on what is there, and if she does go there, what she might or might not do when she gets there. </p></blockquote><p>Hint: </p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Each line of the story contains at least 1 rule. The first line contains 3 rules. It will likely be easier to first build most of the path she took using rules for movement and then use the action rules to fill in the rest and build a story. Consider: if she could not pick up a brick wall, say hello to it, or pet it (because those don't make sense with respect to a brick wall), what are the logical directions from which she can approach the brick wall? </p></blockquote><p>Hint:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Some rules my daughter uses:<br> <strong>left up</strong> to her, she'd just <strong>go around</strong><br> <strong>throw</strong> it <strong>right up</strong><br> The opposite of <strong>do</strong> the <strong>right</strong> thing is <strong>don't do</strong> the <strong>left</strong> thing</p></blockquote><p>Partial solution:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Because Left/up means \"go around\" and she would not jump a fence (or, by extension, a wall), she will go around the fence and the wall. Since she \"always\" bends \"down\" to pet a dog, we know how she approaches them. She \"Left\" the playground, went \"right\" home, and went \"right down\" to the ice cream store. These moves are filled in below.  <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/n9Kok.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/n9Kok.png\" alt=\"Partial Solution\"></a></p></blockquote><p>Hint:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> There is a moment on her way home where my daughter exchanges the penny she picked up for a baseball that she encounters. She then carries the baseball with her until at some point later she sets it down.</p></blockquote><p>Hint:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> I think now that I might have made the rule building too vague and the puzzle a too hard as a result. Essentially the idea of rule-building is a rule is created when actions and directions are in the same sentence clause. And other than the dogs, wall, and fence, the rules do not describe where she must go, but what she does when she gets there and also (for path building) why she CAN'T go somewhere.  The rule \"when she goes right/up, throw what she is holding\" can only be executed if she is holding something (unless she has previously at some earlier point eaten ice cream). Likewise the rule \"when she goes left/down, any object she encounters will be left down on the ground\" can only be enacted on objects she could possibly pick up (she cannot \"leave a women's rest room down on the ground\").  There is at least one rule per direction of the 8 possible directions.</p></blockquote><p>Solved:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> She leaves the playground, does not climb a tree, and bends down to pet a dog. She obeys a sign saying keep off the grass (does the right thing), says hello to the lady, picks up a penny, exchanges the penny for the baseball, walks around a wall and a fence, greets a fireman, sets the baseball down on the basketball court, picks up a plastic bottle, exchanges it for the hammer. While carrying the hammer, she does nothing with the flowers, cupcake, radio, sunglasses, and beer. She then says hello to both the guy with the beard and the nurse. Her next move is to <strong>throw the hammer she is carrying at the police officer</strong> and immediately pet a dog. She eats a piece of candy, picks up a can and throws it away. She gets some ice cream, does nothing with the donut and traffic cone, pets a dog, says hello to a kid on a bike, does not play checkers, goes around a stream, pets a dog, yarks in the ladies room, goes around the stroller and heads home.   <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bdcsx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bdcsx.png\" alt=\"solved\"></a></p></blockquote>",

        "Title": "Little Lost Robot",
        "Body": "<p>This puzzle is adapted from Isaac Asimov's short story <strong><em>Little Lost Robot</em></strong> (1947).  For anyone familiar with the story, you will note I have changed many details for sake of brevity (This also means the story's actual solution may not be the best fit).</p><p>Robots in Isaac Asimov stories have an artificial intelligence that is kept in check with three \"laws\" that are at the core of their programming:</p><ul><li><strong>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm</strong></li><li><strong>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law</strong></li><li><strong>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws</strong></li></ul><p>There was a military research station that used a number of robots.  The research involved gamma radiation.  Given the strength of this radiation, it was decided that a human could be safely exposed to it for long as 30 minutes, but a robot's positronic brain would almost certainly be destroyed in less than a minute in that environment.</p><p>The robots, upon observing that a human had been in the contaminated zone for a while, would conclude that the human may be confused or complacent and may overstay their allotted 30 minute window.  The first law outranks the third law, and so the nearby robots would run into the gamma radiation to try and \"save\" the human, even though they themselves almost certainly wouldn't survive the ordeal.  Many robots were destroyed as a result, and no arguments would convince the robots to not take the risk.  Even though the human risk was minute, they are more than willing to die protecting them.  Not even commanding them to stay put could work, as the first law is above the second.</p><p>The lead researcher of the station decided to take a drastic step to correct this problem. He had the robot's programming modified such that the first law was now \"A robot may not injure a human being\" and <strong>omitting the inaction part</strong>.  Now, in theory, the robots could ignore humans left in the radiation zone, even if they had been there for much longer than 30 minutes.</p><p>A few days later, a frustrated researcher told one of the (now modified) robots to \"<strong>Get Lost!</strong>\", not intending the robot to take the phrase literally.  It became evident that the robot did interpret that as a command because after a search nobody could find it.  The lead researcher, upon finding out, became concerned.  If a robot, whose 1st law was modified, went out into the world and possibly let a human die through their inaction, it could be traced back to him and he would surely go to jail.  The lead researcher ordered the station into lockdown and called the best team possible to help save his him from this problem.</p><p>This is where you, a robot detective, come in.  Arriving at the research station, you looked for clues.  Eventually, you found something.  A cargo ship arrived the same day that the robot became lost (it was still docked because the whole facility was on lockdown).  The cargo manifest was for 62 robots; all replacements for the ones lost earlier that week.  There are, however, 63 robots in the cargo hold, all currently in sleep mode.</p><p>You switch the robots on one at a time and question them.  All 63 claim to have been shipped direct from the factory and have no knowledge of this facility or which robot among them is the imposter.  The \"lost\" robot has apparently chosen to follow the \"<strong>Get Lost!</strong>\" command above any command you could give.</p><p>The robots are physically identical, and the positronic brain is too complicated to analyze for differences.  The \"lost\" robot is trying to not be found out, and will try to act exactly as though it is one of the newly built robots.</p><blockquote>  <p><strong>What can you do to identify the missing robot from the 63 robots?</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Clarification Edit:</strong>  The Asimov story has something of a reason for why the lost robot chooses to follow the \"Get Lost\" order above all other orders, but I skipped over it.  From its perspective, it will do practically anything to not be caught.  If you order the robot to do something, it will try to follow along in the spirit of being indistinguishable from the others.  It is hiding \"in plain sight\" so to speak.</p>",

If you win, you live another year. If you lose, he takes your soul immediately. The Devil does not cheat, but he does not play fairly either.</p><p>On the table between you and the Devil are three shells, no... skulls, and a solitary bead, at least you're telling yourself it's a bead. The three skulls are identical, except one has a gold tooth, gleaming in the light, distinguishing it from the other two skulls.</p><p>The skulls are in a line on the table (positions left, centre and right.) You watch him take the bead and place it under one of the skulls. He explains that he will now swap the position of two skulls, either left and centre, or right and centre, many times. The light goes out, you can't see a thing. You can only hear as the skulls slide across the table. Thankfully you can count how many times a swap was made, more than a hundred! The fiery glow returns. You see the three skulls in front of you, including the gold tooth.</p><p>You choose a skull. The Devil lifts it, revealing the bead. Disappointed, he vanishes, plunging the room back into darkness. It's difficult to sleep with the smell of sulphur in the air... and with the excitement that now you know that you can live forever!</p><p>What is your strategy to win the game every time and live forever?</p><ul><li>The three skulls are originally in random order. The gold tooth is visible.</li><li>The bead is originally placed under any of the three skulls, and you know which one.</li><li>You know exactly how many swaps were made, but not which pair of skulls were swapped.</li><li>Each swap swaps the positions of either the left and centre skulls, or the right and centre skulls, but never the left and right skulls.</li><li>The bead remains in the skull it started in.</li><li>The gold tooth is visible at the end of the game.</li><li>The Devil does not cheat.</li></ul>",

In particular, each person receives the membership lists of every organization of which they are <em>not</em> a part (and none of the lists of the organizations they <em>are</em> a part of). Worse, since membership in an organization changes year to year, no one is sure which organizations they belong to (or even if they belong to any) nor how many organizations there are. Everyone receives the erroneous mailing the same morning (and this is common knowledge) and quickly discover the nature of the error (i.e. that <em>everyone</em> received the mailing from all the organizations they were not a parto f).</p><p>The good news is that all the organizations hold a daily meeting at noon in the town center, visible to everyone. Moreover, everyone knows that there is at least one organization in the town.

Anyone who is not sure will stay home to avoid embarrassment. If an entire organization's worth of people go to the town center, they will recognize this fact (by magic), and have a proper meeting.

Each segment could be lit up or turned off.

        "Title": "Who shall come to the tea party?",
        "Body": "<p>All of your stuffed animals are assembled, anxiously waiting to learn who will be be invited as the Guest of Honor to your next tea party.  </p><p>This is to be an exclusive party, after all, as there is to be only <em>one</em> Guest of Honor.  This is by necessity, because you have only two strawberry pastries, and you obviously intend to eat one of those yourself. (Cook was most annoyed with you for taking so many infinite bags of pastries yesterday, and has since cut off your supply).  All the other guests at the tea party shall only receive tea.</p><p>So now you must decide which of your many guests will be the Guest of Honor, who receives the coveted strawberry pastry.</p><p>Your first instinct, of course, is to invite the valiant Mr. Bun to be the Guest of Honor.  After all, he's brave and noble and always tells the truth.  But then you think of poor insidious Duke Froggington II, who admittedly is dastardly and always lies, but in your heart you know that these character flaws are only due to his tragic childhood.  You see, the perfidious Duke Froggington II grew up all alone in a dank 30-meter well, trying to leap his way to light and freedom.  You know what that's like, and your heart aches for him.  And there are similar reasons why you might choose almost any of the six dozen other stuffed animals that pack every available surface in your bedroom.</p><p>No, you find that you're completely unable to decide which stuffed animal should be the Guest of Honor at your tea party, and so you instead devise a game for the stuffed animals to play, to determine the Guest of Honor fairly.</p><p>The game works in this way:</p><p>First, you choose Mr. Bun as the initial nominee as Guest of Honor.  He's the obvious first candidate, as the noblest of all your stuffed animals.</p><p>Then, starting with the nefarious Duke Froggington II and descending through the other stuffed animals in order of seniority and ending with Peanut (an ugly mouse given to you by your annoying older sister at your last birthday fête, and usually tucked far back in your dresser behind your latin coursebooks), each stuffed animal still in attendance is asked if they wish to declare themselves to be the new nominee as Guest of Honor.  If they do, then they become the new nominee, and the previous nominee is returned to the toy chest, where they must remain until after the tea party.</p><p>Whenever the nominee changes, the whole process starts again;  Every animal (in order of seniority, and starting with the most senior remaining animal) is given a fresh opportunity to nominate themselves, even if they had previously chosen not to.  As before, if an animal chooses to nominate themselves, the current nominee is returned to the toy chest, and may not attend the tea party.</p><p>This process continues until no further stuffed animals wish to declare themselves as the nominee.</p><p>Once no more stuffed animals wish to make themselves the nominee, whoever remains as the nominee shall become the Guest of Honor and will receive a strawberry pastry at the tea party.  The other remaining stuffed animals shall receive tea.  Any stuffed animals in the toy chest get nothing. (At least, not until they're brought out again for the next tea party (which will likely be in ten minutes or so))</p><p>A few obvious points which you know instinctively are:</p><ul><li>All stuffed animals <em>love</em> strawberry pastries (as does everyone of refinement and distinction.  Peanut would probably love strawberry pastries too, despite having neither refinement nor distinction, though you've certainly never wasted one on her, even yesterday when you had several infinite supplies of them).  This means that each stuffed animal dearly wishes to be the Guest of Honor.</li><li>All stuffed animals like tea, so none of them wish to completely miss the party by being put back into the toy chest.</li><li>All stuffed animals are perfect logicians (I mean, obviously.  Do I even need to mention this?)</li><li>Stuffed animals don't hold grudges against one another;  they will remain fast friends even if one sends another to the toy chest.  On the contrary, they will recognise that it was the only logical thing to do, and will probably laugh about it at your next tea party, later this afternoon.</li><li>While the treacherous Duke Froggington II always lies, you've long since adapted to that, and aren't ever confused any more about what he means when he tells you which door leads to certain doom and which leads to your afternoon Latin classes (though you're still not convinced that there's actually much of a difference between the two).  Similarly, there will be no confusion on your part about whether or not he wishes to become the new nominee, regardless of what lies he might say.</li><li>For the sake of clarity, you have six dozen and two stuffed animals in total.  With Mr. Bun as your favourite, the despicable Duke Froggington II as your second favourite, and Peanut as your least favourite.  Other stuffed animals may be identified by number, with the next animal after the treacherous Duke Froggington II being number 3.</li></ul><p><strong>Of your stuffed animals, how many will attend your tea party, and which will be the Guest of Honor?</strong></p>",

When observed in their natural habitat, these creatures tend to flock to two distinct places, traveling vast distances between those two places with basic machinery. Most meatsack individuals are obsessed with a rectangular object in one of those places, where they spend up to a third of their time in a horizontal position. Meatsack individuals communicate by means of air movement, which seems inefficient. Some individuals are part of a hivemind that calls itself \"world wide web\". Lacking other options, this seems to be the most efficient way of communicating with these beings if necessary. <br><br> Analysis on the abducted individuals of this race show an inefficient large structure around an otherwise small computational core. The fact that this computational core seems only capable of having one of seven distinct states at a time shows how inferior this species is compared to us. Data about these distinct states will be encoded with <s>a through g</s>0 through 6. These computational states refer t[REDACTED]. <br><br> External stimulation of the computational core of meatsack individuals results causes the computational core to cease functioning. The meatsack hivement seems to respond better. The hivement seems obsessed with static imprints of furballs and meaningless numbers. We might be able to use this fact to our advantage.<br><br>Addendum: Meatsacks seem to refer to the computational core as a \"brain\".</p>  </blockquote>    <p><strong>Meatsack communication (Hint 2)</strong></p>    <p>We have translated our research on meatspeak and communication of meatsack subjects for you.</p>    <blockquote class=\"spoiler\">    <p> Meatspeak subjects communicate via the following means: <ul> <li>Movement of air. Meatsacks have recepticles near their computational core to decode the patterns. Information density is low. Decoding the signal is simple, but producing a signal is significantly harder. Due to the limited reach and low information density, this method of communication is not worth our time.</li> <li>The hivemind. Meatsacks communicate via a number sequence. Information density is low, but throughput is high. An easily identifiable sequence of numbers is used to encode imprints. We are unsure how to decode these imprints, but most imprints are stored with meatspeak sentences that allows us to identify what they should encode. The hivemind seems capable of producing information at will and seems only limited by the throughput of information channels. We can easily change this by accessing the hivemind from multiple access points. It's unclear how meatsacks interface with the hivemind. Our research has not succeeded plugging their computational core into their hivemind.</li> </ul> The state sequence recovered from the computational core of the deceased subject does not seem to be any of these things. There are too many states to decode the sequence as air movement, even if part of the sequence is to signify timing. There are far too little states to decode as simple meatspeak used in the hivemind. Complex meatspeak seems to use even more states. The sequence is not of one of over 50 imprint formats we found. <br><br> <em>Do meatsacks communicate in an other way?</em> We have not found a significant amount of signals between the computational cores of any meatsacks we have studied. Meatsacks leave pheromone trails, but they seem ineffective in communicating anything. Meatsacks move around \"food\" items, but besides those they move around lots of other mundane items. Some of these are \"tools\" and things to protect them from the environment. A lot of these objects seem completely useless. The objects seem of similar size, and show similar signal readings. There is no significant alpha or beta decay, no significant heat signal, no significant energy reading. Could they be communicating something with the number of these items? That seems even more inefficient than communicating with air movement.</p>  </blockquote>    <p><strong>Another message (Hint 3)</strong></p>    <p>We extracted this message from a different meatsack.

Their words twist and wind like an Egyptian asp, clouding your mind and making you lose hope.</p><p>One day, seeking an answer, a young boy asked the Oracle, \"Where do you get your answers?\" The Oracle sighed and started to cry, slapping the boy on the back.\"Son, I've been doing this since Jesus was a little tyke you're age, and I still can't figure it out.\"</p><p>Suddenly, a rolling, chortling bail of laughter filled the air and ravens leapt for the sky.<br>\"Why little boy, it is I,<br>the Riddler of Life, you see.<br>When the Oracles are lost, or all in a fuss,<br>advice from me they seek.\"<em><br>\"Now, the Cheshire's mad, The Joker glad,<br>they all try to lead you astray.<br>But stay with me,<br>and then you'll see,<br>a world you've never imagined.\"</em></p><p>The Riddler of Life was a weary old grandfatherly figure, but the wicked glint in his eye caused the little boy to shiver and quiver.</p><p>\"What, don't believe what you see? Well then, here's the question:\"</p><p><strong>Puzzle 1</strong></p><blockquote><p>Of Sugar sweet, and frogs astray,of rocks and things, and everything nice,what in the world is my advice?</p></blockquote><p>The Young man thought for a moment, and then grinned as he gave the answer:<br> \"Easy; what's the _____ of Life?\"</p><hr /><p><strong>Act 2</strong><em><br>The Riddler of Life grinned and wrought the boy's hand,<br>\"Ah, I think you'll do nicely.<br>I'm the Wandering Jew,<br>over a thousand and two,<br>and my life is slowly ending.<br>But before I leave,<br>my wisdom to seed,<br>I need someone young and understanding.<br>Will you take from me, the powers that be,<br>a sharp wit and a mind of stone?\"</em></p><p><em>\"Why, certainly!\"<br>He said with glee,<br>and the Riddler beamed delightfully.\"Well, there, don't you see?<br>That beaten tree?<br>Well, there's the clue for your answer.\"<br><br>\"The answer to what?\"<br>The boy said in fraught.<br>\"Why, to the question I asked you to seek!\"</em></p><p>The boy heaved a sigh,<br>and scratched his behin',<br>and went to find the answer.</p><p><strong>Puzzle 2</strong></p><blockquote><p>First a bird, nearby plane,<br>no, a shattered sky!<br>puzzle the letters and find out why.</p><p>A screen, not reflecting,<br>a deep brown hue,<br>a reference makes me feel real blue.</p><p>A joint most fitting,<br>D'el('s) bow string never fitting.<br>the valley splits between.</p><p>mesh the words, you will find your answer:<br><strong>the answer that you seek.</strong></p></blockquote><hr /><p><strong>Act 3</strong><em><br>The boy scratched his head,<br>his brain worse than dead:<br>\"The answer, it's not,<br>just a clue, you clot!!\"<br>So with a sigh,<br>and a tear in his eye,<br>he went to make sense of it all.</em></p><p>The Riddler dozed peacefully, propped on the wall, a scroll lying down beside him.<em><br>\"Congratulations,\" it read,<br>\"You're building your head,<br>with the logic that we cherish greatly.<br>Now, you're almost done,<br>but the sun's stretching lon',<br>and I fear I am quickly dying.<br>My last gift to you<br>is my blessing, it's true,<br>and the final answer that's ringing.\"</em></p><p>\"Ringing where? In my hair?\" Ask the boy all befuddled, as he read the old tattered scroll aloud.</p><p><strong>The Answer:</strong></p><blockquote><p><br>With tips of three,<br>what could I be?<br>A book, a crook, a surly cook,<br> use me segmentedly!!!</p><p>Gassy Silena garnished me,<br>though of a form, a rose I be.</p><p>And once you've solved me, you may see:<br>I'm a piece of pie,<br>a rude, crude man,<br>a real clean freak.</p></blockquote><p>Now tell me my friends, what was in his head, the mind of this Riddler so deep?For truly, it's bold, that story of old, that I inherited just this week.My great-great-grandfather told his son, who told his son, and know I have the Knowledge.</p><p>But, ever willingly, it's true,<br> and thus I give to you,<br>the advice of the Riddler of Life.</p><p><em><br>May its wisdom guide you,<br>nurture, never bind you,<br>and keep you always from strife!!!<strong><br>What did it say,<br>that's still true today,<br>it's truth putting all in perspective?</strong></em><br>-- The Riddler of Life</p><p>Note: Partial answers <em>highly</em> encouraged. Good riddle hunting, my friends. ;}</p><p>P.S.  Congrats to @knave for finding the answer to Part 1! But, as most of you have realized, that was only a warm-up!! Who will be worthy of leading the Oracles for the next millennia?</p><p>P.P.S.  Congrats to @McMagister for solving puzzle #2. Now, who will put the various clues together and find the final answer?</p><p>P.P.S. alright.

You may choose to play or draw, but winning on the play is faster than winning on the draw.<br>If two solutions are equally fast, the better solution is the one that deals more damage (or life-loss).<br>If two solutions are equally fast and equally damaging, the better solution is the one that uses less cards.<br>If your solution involves taking extra turns, it will be scored based on how many turns your opponent got.

It can also \"Bunny-Hop\" over another bunny. Here's an explanation of how this is done:</p><p>Let's say that, in the following image, the white bishop is a bunny named Henry, and the black bishop is a bunny named George. Henry can move onto any of the pawns. He can move onto the pawns diagonal to him by simply moving there normally (bunnies can move diagonally in any direction 1 space). It can capture the pawn 3 squares north of it by jumping over George. When a bunny jumps, it moves 3 spaces in the direction that's it's jumping. George is north of Henry, so Henry must be jumping north. So, he's jumping north 3 spaces, onto where that pawn is. <b>Additionally,</b> George must move south one space, because when a bunny jumps over another bunny, the bunny it jumps over (George) must move to the original position of the bunny that is jumping (Henry)</p><p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/38oFEm.jpg\" alt=\"bunny jumping example\"></p><hr><p>The board starts with 2 bunnies, one on a white square, one on a black square. You may choose the initial positions as long as the bunnies are on squares of different colors.</p><p>How can you alternate moves (move <strong>Bunny 1</strong> during 1 turn, then <strong>Bunny 2</strong> during the next) so that each bunny moves to each space on the board, exactly once? Note that each bunny must step on every one of the 64 squares, so they will each move 63 times. <strong>It will be at most 63 turns.</strong></p>",

I aim for it, and I have never seen this carving. I took a mental note of it and continued home.</p><p>After arriving at home, I noticed a note on the front door from the post office, but it was all scrambled up!

In the room next to mine stayed a family - the parents and two children of elementary school age - who looked a bit stressed, especially the parents, but otherwise perfectly normal and not noticably different from any other guest.</p><p>However, I soon noticed something odd about this family:<br>Every morning, they would all leave their room on the 10th floor and take the lift down to the lobby on the ground floor to have breakfast. After they had all finished eating, they would take the lift back to the 10th floor and prepare for a day full of... whatever it is a family does on their summer holiday.<br>Every evening however, they would take the lift down to the lobby, eat, and afterwards <strong>take the stairs</strong> back to their room. This struck me as weird, because the lifts were all in perfect working order, and I used them myself within minutes of them disappearing into the staircase in order to get back to my room. One day I walked out of the lift just as they arrived at their door, all four of them sweating and breathing heavily, looking like they all had much rather taken the elevator than climb ten flights of stairs.</p><p>I did not dare ask them why they insisted on this strange evening ritual, but after thinking about it for a while in the silence of my room, the answer became clear.</p><p>So, what was the reason for my neighbour's behaviour?</p>",

His secret: He associates a trip with each combination.</p><p>Here are a couple of examples:</p><p>For his original store, the trip he remembers is</p><blockquote>  <p>Belgium --> Germany --> France, and the combination is <strong>10-17-29</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>For his second store, the trip he remembers is</p><blockquote>  <p>Saudi Arabia--> Iran --> Qatar, and the combination is <strong>38-13-35</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>You work at Jeremy's new location, and the cabinet there has 2 combination locks on it. He is always looking for people with excellent problem-solving skills to promote to top managerial positions within the company.

Each area traveled has one and only one number associated with it. The process is not super complicated.

In response to Oren's comment, all countries and many other areas (except 5 of them, which is an unimportant detail), can be turned into a valid number.</p><p>Tip: Ignore lock #2 at first, and when you have figured out a method, apply it to lock #1.

In fact, from my own quick and non-technical figurings, this format is the <em>only</em> possible format that can fit such a challenge.

But, it is actually possible to additionally deduce which guard is which as well. This extension is motivated by the fact that none of the answers given in the linked classic accomplish this additional task.</p><p>You may notice that this extension is not possible to solve if we can only distinguish yes or no answers from a single yes or no question (one bit of information is not sufficient).</p><p>Note that <em>a single yes or no question</em> can actually receive <em>four distinct answers</em>, making this puzzle solvable. The other two answers are represented by a paradox (the guard can't answer) and by tautology (the guard can answer either yes or no).</p><p>The goal of this puzzle is to find a question that expects a yes or no answer, such that depending on whether it was: answered with a yes, answered with a no, couldn't be answered, or was simultaneously answered with a yes and a no; You can deduce the information about both the guards and the doors.</p><hr /><p><strong>The puzzle</strong></p><blockquote><p>You find yourself in a cryptic room with two guards, each guarding a door and carrying a key.</p><p>One guard is a truth teller (T), and the other one is a liar (L). You can't tell which one is which. Similarly, the doors are indistinguishable from each other. You know that one of the two doors leads to Freedom (F), and the other to damnation (D).</p><p>The truth teller holds the key to the freedom door, and the liar holds the key to the damnation door. The only way to freedom is to both pick the correct door and the correct key (guard).</p><p>The only thing you are allowed to do before picking a door and a key, is to ask a single yes or no question to one of the guards.</p><p>If the guard is given a choice to answer either truthfully or untruthfully, they will follow their inclination and answer with either a decisive YES or a decisive NO. That is, the truth teller will never lie, and the liar will always lie.</p><p>If the truth teller cannot answer truthfully, or if a liar cannot answer untruthfully, then they will remain MUTE. However, if they can satisfy their inclination with either yes or no answer, they will produce an arcane SCREECH representing a simultaneous yes and no answer.</p><p>What do you ask the guard to deduce both his inclination and the door he is guarding?</p></blockquote><p>There are four scenarios to consider, and four answers we can receive.</p><p>We can be asking T who guards F, T who guards D, L who guards F, or L who guards D.</p><p>The answer will either be a YES, a NO, a SCREECH, or a MUTE response.</p><p>The solution to the puzzle needs to be a question representing a bijection between these scenarios and answers. We know of at least one solution, with variations to it being possible.</p><hr /><p><strong>Warming up</strong></p><p>From now on, we will be discussing answers to the classic <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/2188/two-doors-with-two-guards-one-lies-one-tells-the-truth\" title=\"A reproduction of the puzzle as a Puzzling.SE question\">guards and doors puzzle</a>.</p><p><em>The following part of this post spoils the linked puzzle, and possibly gives hints to solving this puzzle.

Compared to what later happened in Croatia and Bosnia, it was nothing...just conscripts running around the train station with Uzis, but to a 20-year-old American kid it was pretty harrowing. There was talk of bombings along the border and potential border closure, and I'm pretty sure I was on the last train that got out to Austria for several days. So even though I'm in the United States now, I technically never left Yugoslavia...Yugoslavia left me.

However, you do have a time limit. You do have an incentive to defuse the bomb, however. You don't know why, but you have the feeling that if you defuse it, you will be taken out from the room and fed. </p><p>The bomb seems to be divided into 4 different subsections.

I originally allowed this so that sentences like starplusplus's (\"They couldn't teach what they should have taught; imagine trying!) would be possible (two uses of \"they\") - unfortunately, it's proved rather degenerate. While it's nice to know the longest <em>possible</em> sentence, let's find one that doesn't use methoxybenzenes 21 times.</li><li>Proper nouns are not allowed, even if some form of the same word is in the Scrabble dictionary. This means you can't use \"Bob\" as a name even though \"bob\" is listed by another definition.</li><li>In order for your answer to be accepted, you have to explain what your sentence means. Typing a 30-word sentence without explaining it will likely just confuse me!</li><li>I'm not going to be super strict on punctuation, but be reasonable; semicolons, dashes and commas can be used to break the sentence into fragments, and contractions are acceptable as well.</li></ul><hr><blockquote>  <p><strong>(6/3/2015) Update:</strong> I'm no longer allowing use of the same word twice in a sentence.

Each well's water is completely indistinguishable from the pond water, but contains a magical poison that has no immediate symptoms, yet suddenly kills the drinker about an hour after drinking.</p><p>To make things complicated still, each well contains a different variety of poison. If a drinker who has been poisoned by a well drinks the water from another well, the result depends on the relative numbers. If the second well has a higher number then both poisons will eliminate each other and the drinker will be cured. If the second well has the same number or a lower one, it is as though the drinker had only drunk from the first well. For example, if you drink from well 1 and then from well 4 you will not be poisoned, but if you drink from well 4 and then well 1 you will be poisoned as though you had drunk only from well 4.</p><p>As a result of these rules, water from well 6 can cure poison from any of the other wells, but, when drunk by someone who is not poisoned, is incurably lethal.Furthermore, while wells 1-5 are a short walking distance from each other, well 6 is located at the top of an unclimbable mountain on the island that the knight cannot reach but the dragon can fly onto very quickly.</p><p>This sets the stage for the following puzzle: both knight and dragon understand these rules completely, know the numbering of each of the wells, and each want the other dead. Being evenly matched in combat, they arrange a special sort of duel. Each secretly fills a glass of water from one of the island's sources, then meets the other in a field, where they exchange glasses, and drink. They may seek water from any of the island's sources that they can personally reach before and after.</p><p>Is it possible for either the knight or the dragon to ensure it will survive this duel?</p><p>Note: drinking the same poison twice in a row (or 20 times in a row) has exactly the same effect as drinking the poison once.</p>",

He sees the following equations, and he is really impressed by the man's immaculate and unslanted penmanship:</p><p><code>34x4-44x6/528-24x11 = 101</code></p><p><code>21x21x21x5/315-62 = 85</code></p><p><code>34x4-44x9/528-24x11 = 101</code></p><p>The woman looks at the first equation for about 30 seconds and then says \"The first one's right, one hundred and one.\"  Then she looks at the second equation for about 30 seconds and says \"The second one's right, eighty-five.\"  Then she looks at the third equation for about 30 seconds and says \"The third one's right, one hundred and one.\"  The man says \"Thanks\", and then starts to get up from the table.  Anthony quickly flies the drone back to his house.</p><p>After downloading the video recorded by the drone to his computer, Anthony plays it back.  He looks at the equations again, and he can't figure out how the man and woman did the calculations.  Can you explain how they did the calculations?</p><p>Hints:<br>1. Everything about this puzzle and the answer are in base ten.  No other base is used.<br>2. Anthony saw everything that was written down, and he saw it in the correct orientation without mirroring.  The man and woman did not do anything that Anthony couldn't see or hear.<br>3. The man and woman performed the calculations correctly.<br>4. All of the equations use the same calculation method.</p>",

The dilemma is as follows:</p><p>Larry is ordering a private airplane to fly to Mexico for him and his friends: Jeff, Susie, Cheryl, Leon, and Donna. For safety and fuel efficiency reasons, the pilot needs to know the weights of the passengers and their luggage. Getting the weights of luggage is no big deal. However, to get the weights of the passengers there's one problem:</p><p><em>None</em> of Larry's friends will allow anybody to know their weight. To each person, their weight is a very private matter that nobody can know, not even Larry, their partner, or the pilot. So they refuse to tell Larry (or anybody) their weight.</p><p>Assume you can easily solve this with the tools in your own home (e.g. no industrial-sized scale). Assume everybody knows their own weight.</p><p><strong>How does Larry give the pilot the information he needs, while respecting everybody's wish to keep their weight private?</strong></p><p>I have a solution in mind.

You may only take logs of positive real numbers.</li><li>The root function as a binary operator <span class=\"math-container\">$\\sqrt[b]{a}$</span>.</li><li>Unary operations: <span class=\"math-container\">$(\\cdot)!$</span> for integer arguments only (so you can't use <span class=\"math-container\">$\\frac12!$</span> to get <span class=\"math-container\">$\\sqrt{\\pi}/2$</span>), unary negation <span class=\"math-container\">$-$</span>, the square root <span class=\"math-container\">$\\sqrt{\\cdot}$</span>, and floor/ceiling for rounding down/up: <span class=\"math-container\">$\\lfloor\\cdot\\rfloor$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$\\lceil \\cdot\\rceil$</span>.</li></ul><p>Any other operations are not allowed, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_factorial\" rel=\"noreferrer\">double factorials</a> and decimal points.

That is, you can use 44 as a single number without costing an operation. You cannot concatenate things that are not fours, e.g. you can't concatenate <span class=\"math-container\">$\\sqrt{4}$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$4!$</span> to get 224.</li><li>You do not have to use all four fours (e.g. <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/97895/four-fours-to-get-pi/97896#97896\">msh210's answer</a> of <span class=\"math-container\">$\\lfloor 4\\rfloor$</span> is allowed).</li></ul><p>Your score is equal to the number of digits of accuracy <em>per operation</em> used.

Once again, he was up early, way before the alarm. \"Why didn't I quit already? I could stay at home, take care of the baby with Sandra and make puzzles all day!\" he thought with amusement. But he couldn't: Harold loved his job. Being a psychiatrist was not easy at first: Harold had still shivers when thinking about his internship at the Manhattan Psychiatric Center. But after a few years, he had built enough reputation to allow himself to select his patients. He liked them all, and they liked him back.</p><p>\"Let's have a look at the program,\" Harold said while picking his appointment book. \"Mmh, nice,\" he thought. His first patient of the day was Elliot Anderson, who had been suffering from a dissociative identity disorder for a long time, and was still recovering from it. Elliot was one of Harold's favorite patients, since they shared puzzles as a common passion. Lately though, he had been acting strangely: his answers to Harold's questions were more and more evasive and he was late for the last weekly sessions. Harold had decided that he should find out more about the beginning of this mutism. Today, he would ask Elliot about his concerns.After his morning routine, Harold kissed his wife and Anne, his baby, and headed towards his office.</p><p>Upon his arrival, he immediately felt that something was wrong; his secretary came to him and said: \"M-Mister Smith, I don't think Mr. Anderson will be here today.\" \"What are you telling me?\" inquired Harold. His secretary seemed shaken. \"Well, he was here fifteen minutes ago, b-but he went straight into your office...I-I couldn't stop him, doctor, I'm sorry.\" She burst into tears. A bit perplexed, Harold told her to take the rest of the day off. He then proceeded to step into his office. \"It could have been worse!\" he thought. Indeed, there was a big mess: books on the ground, a broken chair, some stains on the carpet. All his belongings usually on his desk were on the ground, too. Instead, there was a book that was not his. He approached his desk and opened it.</p><p>There was nothing written on the first pages. Harold noticed that the paper was very thin. Then, he stumbled across two pages where there were strange symbols:</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDaX6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDaX6.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p><p>Five pages further, he found these few lines:</p><blockquote>  <p>Last week, I was pretty sure to have a big black cat. But I verified.  Clearly, I like you, but obviously, I been utterly mad... Remember  Edwin? I'm certain he's part of it too. Hasten, shrink!</p></blockquote><p>And... nothing. That was it. He didn't understand anything. Why was his office a mess, and what was the meaning of this book? His mind was confused. Suddenly, he remembered that the last sessions ended with Elliot and him discussing puzzles. He took another look at the book, and after a few minutes, he knew. In seconds, he ran away from his office.</p><p><strong>Where did Harold go, and why?</strong></p><hr><p><sub>The story continues <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/43424/the-shrink-and-his-patient-part-2\">here</a>.</sub></p>",

You see almost nobody apart from the occasional servant. As you pass outside through the great double doors at the entrance to the mansion, you overhear part of a heated conversation between two footmen, <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/2383/warspyking\">Warspyking</a> and <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/2718/michael\">Michael</a>.</p><p>\"His Lordship will hear about this!

If you tell him anything about me, your adventures with a certain maid might also come to his attention.\"</p><p>\"He'll never hear a word from you again, I can promise you. You...\"</p><p>As you walk further out along the sweeping drive towards the edge of the estate, the footmen's conversation fades out of your earshot. It is November, and bitterly cold even at noon. The parkland surrounding you is covered in deep snow, but the drive has been kept clear of snow and ice for his Lordship's carriage. The winter panorama is astonishingly beautiful, and you do not even notice the cold.</p><p>You reach the Folly, a small tower just off the main drive where his Lordship is normally to be found at this time of day, poring over his books. A gardener in snowshoes, <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5135/oblongamous\">Oblongamous</a>, is adjusting one of the snow sculptures that are dotted about the grounds, and fails to notice you as you walk up to the Folly and enter silently.</p><p>When you open the single door to the Folly, you find his Lordship sprawled over his writing desk in a pool of blood, clearly quite dead. His body is stiff and ice-cold; he must have been dead for some time. You wonder why nobody has yet found the body and alerted the authorities. Looking around for clues, you see a bloodstained knife lying on the floor just behind the door. Also the electric light is switched off, the only light coming from the sun shining directly through the open doorway. There are no windows. The killer must have turned off the light as (s)he left.</p><p>You leave the Folly, moving northwards across virgin snow towards the mansion. But you have only got a few metres when you hear a piercing scream from behind you. Looking back, you see a maid, <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5106/avigrail\">Avigrail</a>, running out of the Folly in a terrible state. Oblongamous is still nearby; when he hears her story, he checks quickly inside the Folly and then they both go running to the mansion to raise the alarm.</p><p>The bloodstained knife is found to bear the fingerprints of <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/71/gilles\">Gilles</a>, a well-known rival of his Lordship, and the blood is of his Lordship's blood group. At Gilles's trial, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumpole_of_the_Bailey\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his defence lawyer</a> makes the case that his Lordship's death wound is much wider and rounder than the knife blade, and the bloodstains on the knife show it could not have entered the body. He argues that the blood was only smeared onto the knife, and finds a cut on his Lordship's arm which could have been used to produce blood for this purpose. \"Someone,\" he thunders in his final summing-up, \"has been trying to frame my client!\" His eloquence impresses the jury, and Gilles is acquitted.</p><p>Avigrail and Oblongamous both appear as witnesses in court, and say they saw nobody entering or leaving the Folly other than his Lordship.</p><p>The police have nothing to go on, but you can help!</p><p><strong>Who killed his Lordship?</strong></p><p>Bonus question: <strong>how was he killed?</strong></p>",

It's based on the observation that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad\" rel=\"noreferrer\">one-time pad</a> operations are \"transparent\" with respect to each other, and you can remove two nested encryptions in whichever order. Without further ado, let me introduce to you:</em></p><hr><h2>The Padlock Protocol</h2><ol><li><p>Alice wants to send Bob a secret message. To do so, Alice creates a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad\" rel=\"noreferrer\">one-time pad</a> $A$, and uses it to encrypt the plaintext message $P$, obtaining the first cipher message $C_A$. In the analogous box puzzle's terms, <strong>Alice puts the message in a box and locks it with her own padlock</strong>. Alice then transmits $C_A$ to Bob.</p></li><li><p>Bob then generates his own one-time pad $B$, and encrypts $C_A$ with it, producing the second cipher message $C_{AB}$. In the analogy, <strong>Bob adds his own lock to the box</strong>. Bob then sends the doubly encrypted message $C_{AB}$ to Alice.</p></li><li><p>Alice then decrypts $C_{AB}$ using pad $A$. Or, in the analogy, <strong>Alice removes her lock from the box.</strong> This results in the third message $C_{B}$, which Alice send to Bob.</p></li><li><p>Finally Bob uses pad $B$ to decrypt $C_{B}$, and recovers the original message $P$. Or in the box analogy, <strong>Bob removes his own lock, which was the only one remaining on the box.</strong></p></li></ol><hr><h2>The puzzle</h2><p>One-time pad encryption is provably secure. Every transmission was protected by at least one such encryption. Both Alice and Bob kept their pads safely stored. Also, just in case you wondered, this method works, Bob really will receive the original message.</p><p><strong>Yet it is a very bad idea to use the Padlock Protocol for conveying secret messages on an eavesdropped channel.</strong></p><p>You are to take the role of Eve, the eavesdropper. You have observed all the transmissions, and you know all the encrypted messages. They are, in order:</p><blockquote>  <p>Alice to Bob ($C_A$):    <code>SPVJRQQHHPLZXJAILONXJTYOHXCIYWCAPFOXKGRRDXWUEOTAHPWQ</code><br>  Bob to Alice ($C_{AB})$: <code>LWDBZICFVCPSFVEXLRGENKCOYBOILUNIZJWQLAKKKFOIRSBSTXJU</code><br>  Alice to Bob ($C_{B}$):  <code>XCMZIKNMHUXAMBPPIQMLBKENUXTEPGAPOVIGEWTGKMVIPIBZQXNH</code>  </p></blockquote><p>Using no other information, you are to <strong>deduce what was the secret message that Alice wanted to send to Bob</strong>. </p><p>For unambiguity's sake, Alice and Bob used <a href=\"https://www.dcode.fr/vernam-cipher\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this exact variant of the one-time pad cipher</a> with an unmodified alphabet. The puzzle would work with any one-time pad implementation, but figuring out which one they used would be just a lot of non-interesting busywork.</p>",

It would <em>seem</em> like I'm just playing second fiddle to a jive-talking glory hog, but that's not actually the case; we both wound up being really famous and respected.  In fact, I'm arguably more famous than my master, because I get around more--I'm more versatile and less likely to get in the way of people, and I don't need as much gas to get to the same place.</p><p>But now it's all right, it's okay; we'll live to see another day.  As of fairly recently (well after Stack Overflow was founded), both myself and my master are currently being preserved by a very powerful organization for all of time.  We'll both be stayin' alive for a very long time, which is more than can be said of the three men to whom I most owe my existence.  It's a shame that two of them are dead, as we really had a great thing going on; if I can't have them, I don't want nobody else.  The oldest guy is still around, at least, but it just doesn't feel the same without his brothers, too.</p><p>Apparently, the three guys who made me originally worked with three others for a little while, though this was before my time.  They also had a younger brother who did his own separate thing, but I never met him (and he's dead too, apparently).</p><p>Also, who's taller, my master or me?  Well, that's actually an interesting question.  It depends on whether or not he's allowed to show you his penis.  Yes, really.  Though I suppose it doesn't really matter anyway, because we're both about the same height regardless.</p><p>Finally, not that it matters much to me, but everyone generally likes to pretend my master's little brother doesn't exist.</p><h1>Hints</h1><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> It's a very specific thing.

In addition to having just one output tube, it also has <strong>two input tubes</strong>. <em>(click the image to see the full schematic)</em></p><p>Let's recap the rules: (<em>cue near-silent suspense-building music</em>)</p><p>There are <strong>75 White bingo balls</strong>. One of them has been randomly preselected to be the <strong>ODDBALL</strong>. The balls are numbered, so they can be distinguished by looking at them, but not otherwise. All the white balls, including the oddball, are shuffled, and placed into the <strong>white input tube</strong> in a random order. 75 balls, incidentally, is the maximum number of balls an input tube can contain.</p><p>Then there's the <strong>yellow input tube</strong> filled with <strong>75 yellow bingo balls</strong>, indistinguishable from the white balls except by looking.</p><p>The bingo cage is initially empty. (<em>music fades out</em>)</p><p>You are allowed to use these two actions, as many times you want, in any order, and there's no time limit:</p><blockquote>  <p>1: choose an input tube, and drop one ball from its bottom end into the bingo cage. The balls will come out of the input tube in the same order that they were put in. (<em>Actions A and B in the schematic</em>)</p>    <p>2: shuffle the balls that are in the cage, randomly pick one, and place it into the input tube of your choice at the top end of that tube. You can only place a ball into a tube that has 74 or fewer balls in it. (<em>Actions C and D in the schematic</em>)</p></blockquote><p>After you are done, all the balls must be back in the input tubes, and <strong>if the ODDBALL is now in the YELLOW INPUT TUBE, you win the car</strong>! (cue <em>over-the-top sound effects, ridiculous camerawork and scantily clad gentlemen making the cheapo car seem outright luxurious</em>)</p><p>Now, let's check your <strong>blindfold</strong>.. yes, good .. aaaaand <strong>GO!</strong> (<em>cue lights dimming, dramatically suspenseful music</em>..)</p><hr><p><strong>Daily Hint 0</strong>:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/29430/twobitoperation\">@TwoBitOperation</a> has posted <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/81692/36023\">a strategy that gives better than 50% chance of winning</a>.

No one in the society knows what <span class=\"math-container\">$n$</span> is. The dictator of the world, in an effort to erase mathematics from human history, has finally managed to capture all <span class=\"math-container\">$n$</span> members of the society, and has placed them in prison.</p><p>The prison has a funny design. There are <span class=\"math-container\">$n$</span> identical soundproof, windowless prison cells arranged in a circle, each containing a mathematician. The cells all have a light switch the prisoners can use, but the wiring system is screwed up, so the switch controls the light bulb in the <em>clockwise neighboring cell</em>. Furthermore, the switch is only capable of delivering a single flash of light at noon each day. Specifically, if this switch is set to \"on\" at noon, it will flash the next cell, and do nothing otherwise.</p><p>The prison warden worries that the prisoners might try to communicate using the lights, so every night at midnight, he fills all of the cells with knockout gas, cleans the cells so they can't communicate by leaving messages, sets all of the light switches to \"off\", and rearranges the prisoners in whatever fashion he pleases (still one prisoner per cell).</p><p>One day, the warden visits your cell. He confesses that he loves mathematics, and decides to offer your society a game to win their freedom. If any of the prisoners are able to figure out what <span class=\"math-container\">$n$</span> is, they may shout out loud \"There are <span class=\"math-container\">$n$</span> prisoners!\" (the cells are monitored with security cameras/mics). If they are correct, all prisoners will go free, and if not, they will all be executed.</p><p>The warden allows you to devise a plan for everyone else to follow. He will make <span class=\"math-container\">$n-1$</span> copies of this plan, and allow every other prisoner to read it. The warden of course will also read your plan, and will perform the cell rearrangements in such a way to make it fail if he can.</p><blockquote><p>What plan allows the prisoners to guarantee their freedom?</p><p><strong>Extra for Experts:</strong> Can you find a plan which doesn't require the prisoners to make random decisions?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Notes:</strong> There is no lateral thinking required to solve this.

        "Body": "<p>One summer day John was jogging in the countryside wearing only his normal running clothes  (shorts, vest, sports shoes and socks).  After running for some time he saw that the lace of one of sports shoes was untied. While he was bending down to tie it up, a psychopath who was hidden nearby, approached him from behind and hit him on the head so hard that John became unconscious.</p><p>When John recovered he found that he was inside a perfectly cylindrical room about 20 meters diameter and 5 meters high.  The walls, floor and ceiling of the room were perfectly smooth and symmetrical and had no visible feature so it was impossible to distinguish any particular direction inside the room.</p><p>Inside the room there was a cage. The cage itself also was in the shape of a perfect cylinder about 2 meters diameter and 2 meters high.</p><p>The cage was made of solid steel and it had only a very small spherical light bulb inside fixed exactly at the centre of the roof of the cage, and a solid door on one side. The light bulb was fixed to the roof, so that it rotated together with the cage. It was not possible to see anything outside the cage when someone was inside the cage and the door was closed (nor was it possible for someone outside the cage see inside after the door was closed)</p><p>The cage was placed on a perfectly circular platform exactly the same diameter as the cage. The platform can rotate clockwise or anti-clockwise at the discretion of the psychopath, who uses a remote control to start and stop the rotation. The platform starts and stops rotating at a very slow rate of angular acceleration, so slow that someone inside the cage cannot even feel when the platform starts to rotate and when it stops. Also the maximum speed of rotation is so slow that a person inside the cage cannot feel any centrifugal force so he doesn’t even have any idea about how fast the cage is rotating.</p><p>The psychopath then told John that he will challenge him to do a task. If he fails he will die, as have many others before. However, if he succeeds his psychopathic ego will be destroyed, John will be released and the psychopath will give himself up to the police.</p><p>The task consists of this. Surrounding the cage on the floor of the room about 10 meters from the center of the cylinder there are eight glasses each filled to the top with an orange liquid. The glasses are placed at the eight cardinal points: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West and Northwest. One of the glasses is filled up with pure orange juice. The other seven glasses have orange juice with a small amount of deadly poison mixed with the juice. It is not possible to distinguish between the glasses or their contents in any way at all except by tasting the liquid. John is not allowed to go anywhere near the glasses to examine them before the test starts.</p><p>The psychopath then tells John that the only glass without poison is the glass placed in the north direction and tells him which one it is.</p><p>The psychopath does not allow John to leave any mark or object on the floor of the room by which to indicate a particular direction.</p><p>Then the psychopath tells John to get into the cage and the psychopath closes and locks the door. The psychopath remotely turns on the little light in the cage and gives John a couple of minutes to get used to the environment inside the cage. The psychopath then slowly starts to rotate the cage for about one minute then slowly stops the rotation  (which takes about another minute). The psychopath waits another couple of minutes then unlocks the door and tells John to get out and choose a glass from among the eight and to drink it all.</p><p>Before the psychopath unlocked the cage door he had already changed his own position in the room to make sure John was totally disoriented when he got out of the cage and had no possible way to tell from his surroundings in the room which direction he was facing.</p><p>John got out of the cage, quickly chose a glass of juice and drank it. The psychopath was amazed to see that John did not immediately fall down dead so he knew that John had chosen the right glass. He then told John to repeat task many more times until he realized that John had not chosen the right glass the first time just by luck.</p><p>John was released and the psychopath was put in prison for rest of his life.</p><p><strong>How did John manage to succeed in doing the task?</strong></p><p>NOTE: Everything that is described could actually have happened in real life on this Earth.</p>",

So your disappointment is great, when you show up for the game and all they have brought with them was a near-infinite amount of ordinary, six-sided dice.</p><p>While you luckily didn't need to have 'all' dice in your set, the RPG system you want to play with is based on d100 ( usually realized by using two d10 ), and you have to find a way of using (any number) of d6 and any rule you can think of, to realized a value range 0-99 (or 0 to 99).</p><p>One mathematician suggests:</p><blockquote><p>We simply roll twenty of our d6, sum the rolls and subtract 20, that gives us the range (20;120)-20 = (0;100), and we consider both the 0 and the 100 to be 100.</p></blockquote><p>This works, but chances for the various values are rather far from being an equal \"fair\" distribution, so soon the players start a heated discussion on how they can 'best' achieve a fair distribution. They agree on the following metric:</p><blockquote><p>\"Ideally, each value has a chance of 0.01, so the best rule is the one which minimizes <span class=\"math-container\">$\\Sigma(( P_i - 0.01 )^2)$</span>\" - it does not matter how many (finite) rolls of d6 are used.</p></blockquote><p>Under these conditions, what is the \"fairest\" method of getting to a range 0..99 (or 1..100) just using six-sided dice?</p><hr /><h2>Notes:</h2><ul><li>I do not know a \"best\" solution for this (yet)</li><li>the 'algorithm' has to produce any value of the D100 range</li><li>The \"fairest\" algorithm wins. Only if two algorithms are equally fair, the one with less dice rolls wins.</li><li>the 'algorithm' can consist of any mathematical rule which you can think of, but it must be reasonably \"doable\" by a group of mathematicians with nothing but pen & paper (and d6)</li><li>Any <strong>finite</strong> number of d6 ( or rolls thereof) may be used in the 'algorithm'</li></ul><p>Note, that the last rule exclude all algorithms which do not guarantee that a result is reached in a finite number of rolls. (In particular, you can not re-roll until a certain value is rolled. You may reroll 1e106 times though.)</p>",
