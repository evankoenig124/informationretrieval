whole units also pirate would need one set twins mark spot cardinals make sure free cardinals actually nests others get far whats undone clear leap faith metaphor map leap faith youre standing way youre facing matter lot makes sense youre probably standing wrong spot leap faith multiple individual steps instructions fairly direct mostly metaphor minor play words tricks like paired stanza make
