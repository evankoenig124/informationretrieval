49329	youre traveling on a hiking trip in the land of landilandia when you encounter a forest the notes in your guidebook tell you that theres a safe route here leading into the woods but when you approach you discover that there are actually two paths to choose from beside them are three men sitting outside of a tent engaging in some sort of friendly card gamethe first man looks up as you approach he immediately hails you cheerfully saying be aware traveler if you enter this forest you take your life into your own hands for at least one of these paths will lead into periluh thanks you say you look back and forth between the left path and the right one i guess this trip might not be as simple as i was hopingthen man laughs then adds with a wink and seeing as youre probably hoping to find out which path  if any  might be safe to travel you should know that one of us is a knave who always lies one of us is a knight who always tells the truth and one of us is an alternator who strictly alternates between lying and telling the truthwhat an odd custom you had read about people like this in books but this is your first time meeting any in real life but you recheck your trustworthy guidebook and it confirms that this is indeed so men in this particular region of landilandia always travel in groups of three one knave one knight and one alternator and naturally they know which of them is whichhowever your guidebook also notes that there are strict social rules on foreign visitors such as yourself interrogating the locals asking questions that cant be answered with a yes or a no is considered a grave insult and asking too many questions would be tantamount to picking a fight and youre pretty sure you wouldnt winhow can you find a safe path into the forest with the fewest questions possible and a followup question if that one is too easy for you   even though you dont strictly need to know in order to travel safely through the woods you cant help but wonder which man is the knight which is the knave and which is the alternator after a brief internal struggle you finally come up with a compromise between your curiosity and your politeness how can you find a safe path into the forest and correctly identify all three mens roles at the same time without asking the men more than one question each ie not more than three questions total one per man

236	the riddlerandall munroe of xkcd fame has a bit hidden on his site a logic puzzle  a group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island they are  all perfect logicians  if a conclusion can be logically deduced  they will do it instantly no one knows the color of their eyes every  night at midnight a ferry stops at the island any islanders who have  figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island and the  rest stay everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a  count of the number of people they see with each eye color excluding  themselves but they cannot otherwise communicate everyone on the  island knows all the rules in this paragraph    on this island there are  blueeyed people  browneyed people  and the guru she happens to have green eyes so any given blueeyed  person can see  people with brown eyes and  people with blue eyes  and one with green but that does not tell him his own eye color as  far as he knows the totals could be  brown and  blue or   brown  blue and he could have red eyes    the guru is allowed to speak once lets say at noon on one day in  all their endless years on the island standing before the islanders  she says the following    i can see someone who has blue eyes    who leaves the island and on what night    there are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces nothing dumb it is not a  trick question and the answer is logical it doesnt depend on tricky  wording or anyone lying or guessing and it doesnt involve people  doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics  the guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular shes  simply saying i count at least one blueeyed person on this island  who isnt me    and lastly the answer is not no one leaveshe admits the puzzle isnt his  i didnt come up with the idea of this puzzle but ive written and rewritten it over the the years to try to make a definitive version the guy who told it to me originally was some dude on the street in boston named joelthe answerhe gives his solution  the answer is that on the th day all  blueeyed people will leave its pretty convoluted logic and it took me a while to believe the solution but heres a rough guide to how to get there note  while the text of the puzzle is very carefully worded to be as clear and unambiguous as possible thanks to countless discussions with confused readers this solution is pretty throwntogether its correct but the explanationwording might not be the best if youre really confused by something let me know    if you consider the case of just one blueeyed person on the island you can show that he obviously leaves the first night because he knows hes the only one the guru could be talking about he looks around and sees no one else and knows he should leave so theorem  if there is one blueeyed person he leaves the first night    if there are two blueeyed people they will each look at the other they will each realize that if i dont have blue eyes hypothesis  then that guy is the only blueeyed person and if hes the only person by theorem  he will leave tonight they each wait and see and when neither of them leave the first night each realizes my hypothesis  was incorrect i must have blue eyes and each leaves the second night    so theorem  if there are two blueeyed people on the island they will each leave the nd night    if there are three blueeyed people each one will look at the other two and go through a process similar to the one above each considers the two possibilities  i have blue eyes or i dont have blue eyes he will know that if he doesnt have blue eyes there are only two blueeyed people on the island  the two he sees so he can wait two nights and if no one leaves he knows he must have blue eyes  theorem  says that if he didnt the other guys would have left when he sees that they didnt he knows his eyes are blue all three of them are doing this same process so they all figure it out on day  and leave    this induction can continue all the way up to theorem  which each person on the island in the problem will of course know immediately then theyll each wait  days see that the rest of the group hasnt gone anywhere and on the th night they all leave    before you email me to argue or question this solution is correct my explanation may not be the clearest and its very difficult to wrap your head around at least it was for me but the facts of it are accurate ive talked the problem over with many logicmath professors worked through it with students and analyzed from a number of different angles the answer is correct and proven even if my explanations arent as clear as they could be    user lolbifrons on reddit posted an inductive proof    if youre satisfied with this answer here are a couple questions that may force you to further explore the structure of the puzzle       what is the quantified piece of information that the guru provides that each person did not already have   each person knows from the beginning that there are no less than  blueeyed people on the island how then is considering the  and person cases relevant if they can all rule them out immediately as possibilities   why do they have to wait  nights if on the first  or so of these nights theyre simply verifying something that they already know       these are just to give you something to think about if you enjoyed the main solution they have answers but please dont email me asking for them theyre meant to prompt thought on the solution and each can be answered by considering the solution from the right angle in the right terms theres a different way to think of the solution involving hypotheticals inside hypotheticals and it is much more concrete if a little harder to discuss but in it lies the key to answering the four questions abovethe questioneverybody on the island could have come to the conclusion that there is at least one person with blue eyes simply by looking around seeing  people with blue eyes and realising that everybody can see at least one person with blue eyesso why is it necessary for the guru to say i see at least one person with blue eyes to get the ball rolling

260	the first time i encountered the boy or girl paradox i was struck by how ambiguous all of the formulations in english are as wikipedia notesgardner argued that a failure to specify the randomizing procedure could lead readers to interpret the question in two distinct waysfrom all families with two children at least one of whom is a boy a family is chosen at random this would yield the answer of from all families with two children one child is selected at random and the sex of that child is specified this would yield an answer of many formulations have a less technical problem when a parent says that they have two children and one of them is a boy its nearly impossible to read that in english without thinking therefore the other one is a girlcan you rephrase the paradox so that the proper randomizing procedure is specified and the bayesian logic is the crux of the problem

41413	my friend asked me for help with an iq test and after she did it online she came back at me with the ones she couldnt solve two of them however i discovered are the same puzzle type but no matter how much i look at it i just cant see the logic in it we redid the test and this puzzle occurred yet again so now i have three versions of the same type of sequence written below                                i get the feeling that this puzzle is easy yet i just cant see itupdateby request i give the five options for the answer of the top row that i wrote down during the second testthe options are     im actually leaning towards jonathan allans explanation of a mistake in some data entry for their automated question generation right now since no one here seems to have solved it yetprior to my post here my friend emailed them asking them about this sequence so most likely we will know between now and a few daysupdatelooking at the options again this puzzle is really really simple thank you smriti
455	i found this puzzle onlineon the top floor of a castle lives a princess the floor has  bedrooms arranged in a row each bedroom has doors connecting to the adjoining bedrooms as well as to the outside corridor the princess sleeps in a different bedroom each night by opening the door to an adjoining bedroom and spending the night and the next day in that roomone day a prince arrives at the castle and is desirous of marrying the princess the guardian angel at the castle tells him of the princess sleeping patterns and informs him that each morning he may knock on one of the outside doors if the princess happens to be behind that door she will open it and consent to marry him the prince also has a return ticket to his kingdom in  days so he can make at most  attempts can the prince win the hand of the princess and if so what is his strategyan unstated assumption here is that the princess can move to any adjacent room shes not restricted to moving in one direction so a possible sequence could be          further down the thread at the link this solution is giventhe prince should knock on the second door from one of the ends of the corridor call it door  and knock on the next adjacent door each successive day until he reaches the second door from the opposite end of the corridor door  the day after that he should begin the same process in reverse order meaning he will knock on the th door two days in a row by the time he reaches his starting point door  on the th day he will have found the princessnumber the doors  thru if the princess occupies an even numbered room on the day the prince first knocks on a door  then she will either occupy the same room he knocks on or she will be an even number of rooms away since both move to an adjacent room each day this will hold true so she will never be in a room adjacent to the one he knocks on and thus never be in a position to move past him the next day she will have nowhere else to go by the time he reaches the th door and will have by then been located if she on the other hand was in an odd numbered room when he began then she will be in an even numbered room when the prince starts the process again on day  when he knocks on door  the second timeive been trying to follow the solution but i dont quite get it the main assumption the logic in the solution seems to hinge on is this she will never be in a room adjacent to the one he knocks on and thus never be in a position to move past him the next day i cant figure out what evidence from the puzzle supports that assumption if we begin knocking at door  and the princess is in room  our next move following this solution will be to knock on door  but at this point the princess could have moved to room  and we will keep moving to higher numbered rooms and the princess could easily remain in the lowernumbered roomsso im having trouble understanding why this is the solution can someone explain it more clearlyin a different manner why will this process ensure the princess is found

8816	the greatest arithmeticians on this side of the kuiper belt had gathered together on the summit of olympus mons to hold the solar systems first arithmetic summit everyone was very excited  you could hear mutterings about sums and products in at least eight different languages and one dwarf language and you could see mathematicians making their enthusiastic but nonsensical mathematician gestures with anywhere from one to twenty arms or similar appendagesas phobos set the crowd gathered into a circle and went silent in anticipation the keynote speaker a distinguished earthican mathematician stood up and began her address stating various truths about the sums products differences and quotients of pairs of real numbers unfortunately as she continued she realized that the crowd was bewildered  and that every time she said zero the neptunians would make a pitiful noise with their speechglands and every time she said one the mercurians would make what is surely an obscene gesture with their noodly appendagesshe paused and thought and it dawned on herthough every member of the audience knew that her talk would concern only the operations of addition subtraction multiplication and division over the real numbers there was no common languagethe words zero and one are words in other languages but they roughly translate to grievous insults about the aliens version of a face or mother she must not use themwhat series of true statements can she make such that there can be no ambiguity in translation where each statement is of the form  x text op  y  zwith xy and z are real numbers other than  or  and op one of the four elementary operationsunambiguous means that the aliens can determine the meaning of each word only knowing that there are four operations and that the numbers are real but not knowing which operation for instance plus refers to or which number two refers to as they do not speak the language for instanceis ambiguous because if the aliens believed  meant  ie swapped the operations in all equations theyd get the equally correctthus from the first two equations they would not be able to determine the meaning of  as it would be equally true if it referred to division or subtractionfor instance were only  and  to be used and were  and  allowable words the following three statements would be a solutionas the aliens would from the first two be able to deduce that  was the identity element of  and  was the identity element of  the only alternate translation of those two ishowever under those rules the last statement translations tocwhere c is whatever  translates to  but this is false since  and the aliens can recognize that c was not the same word as meant  thus there is exactly one way to translate the first series of three statements
625	there is a puzzle about two spiestwo spies must pass each other two secret numbers one number per spy unnoticed by their enemies they have agreed on a method for doing this using only  indistinguishable stones in advancethey meet at a river where there is a pile of  stones starting with the first spy they take turns throwing a group of stones into the river the first spy throws some number of stones then the second one then the first one againeach spy must throw at least one stone on his turn until all the stones are gonethey observe all throws and diverge when there are no more stones they keep silence all the time and no information is exchanged except number of stones thrown at each turnhow can they exchange the numbers successfully if the numbers can be from  to mto understand the idea you can read the following simple solution for m    lets call the spies spy  and spy  spy  has number n to tell spy  and spy  has number n to tell spy   the spies agree that each number n from  to  shall be represented by a combination of two numbers m m where  le m le  and  le m le  since there are exactly  possible combinations of m m it is possible for them to make this mapping  at the river each spy calculates his pair of numbers m m that corresponds to the number he wants to send  spy  throws stones in the river corresponding to his m then spy  throws stones corresponding to his own m then spy  throws m stones then spy  throws m stones  finally spy  throws all the rest of the stones into the river if any left this solution works because neither spy throws more than  stones so they can never throw more than  in totali know the algorithm for m   i know that an algorithm for m   exists but i do not know what it is i wrote a program that seems to prove that it is impossible to do if m  i would like to know what is the algorithm for m   is it possible to formulate an algorithm for m  please note that people who attempt to solve this puzzle keep making the same mistakespeople forget that due to the alternation rule if spy  needs to make k throws then spy  can make only k or k throwspeople do not take into account that spies must agree on everything in advance therefore it doesnt matter for the second spy how big the first spys number is and how many stones he actually needs to transmit this information each spys algorithm must work for any possible number from  to m that the other spy can want to tell him

50600	the master programmer sat at his desk gazing into the distance his eyes seeing and yet unseeingthe lunch had been heavyhis reverie was interrupted by the appearance of his close colleague anandaah ananda it is you spake the master programmer his very words oozing wisdom how fares your tcl program to classify a list of file names based on their extensionsthe code is written o master and the output created ananda replied but strange are the lines of the output for they are in reverse order of those in the inputthe master smiled doubtless ananda you have been storing your lines in a list and then iterating over its elements in reverse orderno master  my program simply takes a line from the input processes it outputs the result and then moves on to the next like the eternal soul that moves from one body to another the master shook his head  if such be your code ananda then it can only mean that you have scripted somewhere a seek command on one of your filesmy program does not seek o wise one  it is only i who seek an answer to this great mysterythe master laughed  come now ananda  it is no mean task to reverse the order of lines even intentionally and you would have me believe that you have done so by accident  was it not just a few days ago that i explained to you how the insertion of a line at the start of a document is merely an illusion perpetuated by text editors while reality requires the entire file to be rewritten on diskindeed i do remember your teaching master  but if theory and practice be in contradiction with each other then which should one regard as reality and which as illusion o learned onethe master frowned  i find your insistence both annoying and disturbing  come show me this magical program of yours that i may rid you of this delusion once and for allgladly master   in preparation for your visit i have already cleansed my directory of all save my program and the input file  here you see these  lines of input  and here i run the program before your eyes  and now see here in this output file that has appeared those  lines processed but in reverse orderthe master blinkedshall i open the program now masterthe master cleared his throat  unveil it that i too may lift the veil from your eyesas you wish  or tclsh  o master  here it isthe master breathed deeply  lets see  your file is named outputtxt  search  and this name appears only once here in this open command whose result is assigned to this variable ofp  search  and this ofp is used only in this puts command  that prints this variable  which is the result of this string processing  on this variable  which is set by this gets command reading from your input file handle  inside this loop  which    does  nothing else    ananda sat silent  it was the first time that he had heard the master say   the punctuation marks rang in his earsthe master scratched his head  he deleted the output file  he changed the contents of the input file  he ran the program  he saw the output  he cursed silentlyananda watched patientlythe master closed his eyesare you meditating masterbe quiet and let me think  where is the faultcontinued   after a few moments the master opened his eyes  one only has to inquire within ananda he said  and then without a further word his fingers moved swiftly across the keyboard o great wielder of the keyboard said ananda i could only discern two presses of the enter key amidst a blur  pray tell me what two lines of code you did add the master smiled compassionately  it is the selfanalysis technique of the ancients ananda  both the lines are simple puts commands to the console  one after the gets ifp sinput saying puts here  reading  sinput and one before the puts ofp soutput saying puts here  writing  soutput  the output of these two lines shall transcend the structure and logic of your program and tell us what really it is attempting to do  then either we shall know it to be reading backwards or to be writing backwards or perchance we shall find the numbering and sequence of reading and writing to be as it should not be and thusly shall we realize where to look next ananda watched in awe as the master ran the program whose consciousness level had just been raised and lo  there appeared on the screen  lines in all  for reading and  for writing the reading and writing being in exact alternation with each other and both sets in precisely the same order as the input  the only reversal to be seen was on the face of the master after a pause the master smiled knowingly as one smiles when one has truly known nothingness  such a perfect harmony between the reading and the writing he murmured and yet somewhere there is a disturbance in the yin and yang of this program  for though the writing on the console be in order yet the contents of the output file are reversed ummm master ananda interjected i was thinking  maybe we should revisit that theory of inserting a line at the start of a file  the master gave ananda a stern glance  it is no theory ananda it is verily the way of nature  one can only read overwrite or append one cannot insert  these are the three modes of nature r w and a  there is no i ananda sulked the master patted him  no ananda there are subtler forces at play here   notes this is based on an actual incident that happened with me at work last year  the dialogue of course is exaggerated somewhat in the style of the tao of programming this originally occurred in a tcl program on linux but ive confirmed that it also happens in equivalent c programs run on linux or solaris

26033	little bout my age far from that of byet in my syntax you will find some cthe way i treat vars that is much like di do take objects but im not like eif it starts with f youll know its not menow i challenge you just what could i bei guess this should be fairly easy for people who study computerrelated stuffupdate some cluesas of now nobody has guessed the language i am thinking about i understand that this seems to be quite broad and many languages can fit to some degree but my thought is if there are still many candidates then you might as well make the rulesclues given in the riddle stricter and screen the candidates down eg some said that the d line refers to d having local vs global variables but so many languages do so you might want to look deeper into say variable naming conventions clue just an example nothing to do with thatalso here are some additional cluesage the age is farther from b than all four guesses as of the time of writinghow it treats vars think typing and stuffeven more clues also think memory managementobjectsagain since few if any language is like e with respect to the object system things remain pretty broad so you may as well look at a certain aspect of it to screen candidates more specifically the philosophy e very strongly adheres to oopalso i might need to clarify that objects can mean anything but i did mean it in the oop sense an abstraction of a value or set of values with specific functions that are owned by and can operate on it methodsone more really big clue if it starts with f is actually trying to suggest the first letter in the languages name is importantwith this one i probably made it too easy thoughthe explanationso chiel ten brinke got it right the correct answer is go official sitewikipedialittle bout my age far from that of b go was created in the  just  years ago the clue doesnt give a specific range but at least one can expect no possible answer to be older than cyet in my syntax you will find some c gos syntax although pretty special in the family is largely based off c with c keywords curly braces operators etc also although there isnt always a semicolon after statements they are just implicit its perfectly fine to use semicolons like in c and that would be required to separate statements when doing inline stuff however that still doesnt throw c c java etc out of the pool of candidatesthe way i treat vars that is much like d i stated in the extra clues that one should look at memory management and typing system now d has static strong inferred typing with automatic memory management as in delete vars when they are no longer needed inferred alone throws many languages out of the question but since i didnt explicitly talk about type inference it is just a quite probable but unconfirmed constraint automatic memory management filters out c and friendsi do take objects but im not like e in the extra clues i said the language was not like e that it doesnt adhere strongly to oop so c and java are out too as well as eiffel which was one of the answers you can find below go doesnt have classes but structs can have methods so oop is pretty well supported but the language itself doesnt emphasize oopif it starts with f youll know its not me in the extra clues i mentioned that starts is trying to suggest that the first letter in the languages name is important now if you see that the riddle went all the way from b to f and the first letter is important it should be logically sound to think the language starts with g the next letter in the sequence thats not necessarily the way you should think you can also say that its eiffel if not for the other clues the other best candidates thus far rust and swift couldnt fit thisso in the end the ones who guessed rust and swift did very well they only missed the bcdefg clue also kudos to klaws for suggesting deesel the answer only misinterpreted the line about e it was about objects not variables

17945	im posting this from the roof of a building because i cant figure out a safe way down ive scoured the roof for anything useful and all i found was a coping saw i also found a  foot ladder which is firmly connected to the roof but its length is just hanging from the secured top rung the building is unfortunately  feet tall how can i use the coping saw to double the length of the ladderthe wind is really strong so i will not consider climbing down any arrangement which could possibly be blown apart  that is if it is possible to separate pieces of the arrangement such that they would not longer function as a  foot ladder i will not climb it the ladder is unbendable cannot be cut by anything other than the saw and cannot be mended once cut it starts out as one solid piece of material the saw cannot cut anything other than the ladder and there are no other materials around i am capable of making precise cuts if necessaryin short how do i use one of thesehskipinto double the length of one of thesehskipinit is necessary for the intended solution that the coping saw blade can be released on one side threaded through an existing cut and reattached a keyhole saw would probably also work but it would be difficult to make the necessary cut the puzzle is not so much in how one physically makes the cut but rather what cut is made i have managed to double the length of the pictured ladder with the pictured tool

100217	there are good explanations on this site and xkcd of the inductive reasoning leading to the riddle’s solution but nowhere have i found an answer to the following aspectexactly what information is learnt — and by whom — after the first nightmy question is triggered by the following train of thoughteverybody knows that everybody sees at least  blue pairs of eyeswith this knowledge everybody concludes that nobody will leave during the first nightsince everybody knows that everybody will derive this it seems to me that “nobody leaves” is common knowledgeif it indeed is common knowledge then no new information is learnt so the second day is exactly like the firstin this case nobody would ever leave because the system is staticassuming that randall munroe’s solution is correct my statement on common knowledge must be incorrect however i am unable to prove thati think the crucial point here is that all hypotheses that involve less than  pairs of blue eyes are irrelevant because every observer knows that no observer can observe a lower number this intuition collides with the tower of nested hypotheses constructed in the inductive proof so which way is right and which way will lead to the immediate collapse of this universeplease refrain from answering with cases that involve less than  blueeyed people consider that my reasoning above requires that everybody knows that everybody sees at least two pairs of blue eyes there are no induction steps within my question nor should they be needed to answer my questionthanks to timc’s answer i was able to come up with a more precise way of asking my question the core of it is “why do all nested hypotheses need to be considered”

124930	to allow new users to solve this puzzle and earn reputation points i encourage all users whose reputation is  or more to not post an answer until  hours after this question is posted thank youyou are at a crossroads with five roads leading awayfrom it and you dont know which direction to go you would like to choose randomly with equal probability for each roadif your only way of making random choices is to flip a fair coin one that could come up heads or tails with equal probability you could assign one of the roads to each of the sequences hhh hht hth htt and thh those outcomes are all equally likely so you know that if you flip three times and choose the corresponding option each one of them will have an equal chance the problem is that there are three outcomes that are not assigned to any road so if one of those three comes up you will have to try again therefore it could take you arbitrarily long to make your decision if you are unlucky and keep getting one of the unassigned outcomesyou dont have all day to stand around so youd like a better method but it turns out that people have proved there is no process with a single fair coin that is guaranteed to finish in a finite amount of time and choose one of five options with equal probabilitynow suppose you are allowed to have more than one type of coin each one marked with the probability that it comes up heads whats the fewest flips you would need to choose your direction how many coins do you need and whats a set of probabilities for the coins that lets you do it in that minimal number of flipsbonus question  can you do it with just one coinclarification of bonus question  in other words does there exist a single coin with a certain fixed probability you can pick the probability of landing heads when randomly flipped such that there is a process that is guaranteed to allow you to select one of the roads randomly each with probability  with a finite number of coin flipsthis puzzle comes from the prison mathematics projectnewsletter fall   iteration i created the roadway diagram

76465	note i have invented this puzzle myself as far as i know im certainly not aware of having read it anywhere else i have no idea whether it will be hard or easya man is imprisoned in a strong steel cage with a steel floor the cage is open at the top but the vertical bars are greased and cunningly designed and no matter how hard he tries he will never be able to escape that way he has no access to tools nor anything he can make tools from every day he has access to adequate food water bedding and toilet facilities edit plus shelter from the elements but none of these can be used to break out of his prisonoutside the cell is another similar cell that encloses it it has no facilitiesoutside that is a yet larger cell enclosing that one it has no facilitiesthis goes on like russian dolls for some timethe man can see the outside world through all the bars he knows that if he can escape from the cages he will be released the guard throws him a keyring with keys to all the doors of all the cages and departs back to the guardhouse the man desperately wants to escapeinstead he stays in the inner cage for a long time before leaving later he ventures into the next cage but soon returns to the inner cage and stays there for a long time then he ventures to the next cage but returns once more to the inner cage he repeats this as many times as there are cagesfinally he walks free and never returns to the cages again on the way out he takes out his wallet and pays the guard a substantial amount of money he is safe and free for the rest of his lifewhat is going onclue   the man and the guard are the only two people or creatures involved in the situation but there was a mobile crane in use just before the above story starts it also leaves before the story starts however the crane was not used to lift any part of the cages or other equipment and was not used to help the man escape in any waynotesthe cages are plainly built with unclimbable bars and are roughly squareshaped each has a single door if the cages werent there the man could easily walk to the guardhouse in a couple of minutesthere is nothing designed to frighten or hurt the man about the setup  edit to address questions in the comments    display name  this is describing a real man in a real situation  whether it will ever happen in real life is debatable but it just  might    cr  the man is not wrestling he is alone in the cages the whole  time    displayname  the cages do not reach all the way to the guard house  they are fairly close in size with a relatively small gap in between it would  have been more sensible of me to make them square but all of the same  height i just didnt think of that the height just needs to be enough for them to be unclimbable    fakedad  you ask if the geometry of the cages is important on  thinking about it ive added that tag so yes however he cant climb  or break out and the only exit to each cage is its door that is why  he needed the keys    hugh  having looked at the definition of the story tag i dont  think it comes under that category clearly there is a story involved but id say this is more of a situation ill look into this  further though    jimm  the locks and keys are wellmaintained and are just normal ones that open easily with no special tricks or timelimits the man can open or lock them at will    steve v  as long as the man is constrained to leave by the doors and cant break or bend or damage anything it doesnt matter what the cages are made of

sight the book titlerecover the book title   robert lewis stevenson treasure islandthis is an example of a book suitable for this puzzle because   words outward voyage hint at heroes travelling by the sea and with a bright lookout hints that they are searching for a feature in the sea i e a reef a ship or an island this limits the search for the answer to the known works of fiction with island in the namemore examplesi will give more examples that i deem good below both for the sake of clarity and for your entertainmentthe cub who had thus received a name in the world lay and watched for a time the mananimals continued to make their mouthnoises then grey beaver took a knife from a sheath that hung around his neck and went into the thicket and cut a stick book title watched him    the cub and mananimals hint at an animal story and specifically one told from the animal perspective grey beaver sounds like a native american name  nickname combine the two to get white fang by jack londonwe have devoted several centuries to inventing and elaborating book title as a universal language and method for expressing all intellectual concepts and all artistic values and reducing them to a common denominator   the title of the book is a universal language system and is a method of expressing both science and art few authors have dared to combine science and art in one action and even fewer named their books after such actions the answer is the glass bead game by herman hessethe human beings did not hate book title any less now that it was prospering indeed they hated it more than ever every human being held it as an article of faith that the book title would go bankrupt sooner or later and above all that the windmill would be a failure they would meet in the publichouses and prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down or that if it did stand up then that it would never work    again human beings are contrasted to the main characters of the work of fiction so they might be animals if book title can go bankrupt it should have a kind of company enterprize factory etc in the title combine to get animal farm by george orwelli have to

be book title and all i know it’s crazy but that’s the only thing i’d really like to be i know it’s crazy   a monologue declares that the character wants to be someone and his main responsibility will be to catch people naturally he is a catcher specifically the catcher in the rye by j d salingercant we he pleaded to the world to himself to the officials to the machine cant we take it back cant we make it alive again cant we start over cant we he did not move eyes shut he waited shivering he heard travis breathe loud in the room he heard travis shift his rifle click the safety catch and raise the weapon there was book title   making alive again and starting over hints at time travel stories then in the second paragraph sounds are thouroughly listed loud breathing shifting a rifle clicking the catch we are safe to assume that the book title will have a sound specifically a sound of thunder by ray bradbury“you are a silly little boy” said the book title “just an ignorant silly little boy” simon moved his swollen tongue but said nothing “don’t you agree” said the book title “aren’t you just a silly little boy” simon answered him in the same silent voice “well then” said the book title “you’d better run off and play with the others they think you’re batty you don’t want ralph to think you’re batty do you you like ralph a lot don’t you and piggy and jack”   a work of art clearly depicting little boys and their wrongdoings too much conflict to be peter pan its lord of the flies by william goldingi’d rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard but i know you’ll go

characteristic spelling intentionally left out even in the placeholder does not give this one away think of things that are typically put at the graves food books anyway flowers come to my mind first seeking for a work of fiction with flowers in the title its flowers for algernon by daniel keyes“the common people pray for rain healthy children and a summer that never ends” ser jorah told her “it is no matter to them if the high lords play their book title so long as they are left in peace”   first theres something that high lords play so we have a good chance of guessing right by looking for titles containing game a medieval fantasy series with lots of high lords game of thrones by george r r martinone of the recurring philosophical questions is “does a falling tree in the forest make a sound when there is no one to hear”which says something about the nature of philosophers because there is always someone in a forest it may only be a badger wondering what that cracking noise was or a squirrel a bit puzzled by all the scenery going upwards but someone at the very least if it was deep enough in the forest millions of book title would have heard it   might be the hardest ones who hears the sound in the forest but for the people and animals insects possibly supernatural beings more fitting for the title of a book raising philosophical questions millions of supernatural beings

118202	if you want to know how much  is you can just type it into a computer and it will spit out a really big number but that is no fun the task is to estimate   with some computation which can be checked and followed without computer aid and that can be written down on at most one sheet of paper theoretically one could compute the exact number on paper but that is no fun either and certainly wouldnt fit on a single sheetanswers should be in the form of scientific notation something like  cdot  and be within pm  of the exact value which my computer tells me is around but just getting the correct number of digits is already non trivial
110010	in chess it is possible for a piece to have only one legal move for example in this position the black king can move only to hgiven thatall  pieces are available for useconstructa position with as many pieces as possible that have only one legal movehowever and this is the catch in the event of a tie the position that can reached the quickest ie it has the shortest proof game winsnow off you go the first answer that fulfills the main question and gives proof for their tiebreaker game gets the checkmark
19914	before you stands a building with nfloors  on each floor there is an open window  you have two identical glass balls  if you were to drop a ball out the window onto the ground below it might or might not break  your goal is to determine the highest floor for which dropping a ball out the window results in the ball not breaking  you can continue dropping the balls out the window as long as at least one of the balls remains intact  example  you go to floor  and drop a ball  it doesnt break so you go to floor  and try again  this time it breaks so you can no longer use that ball but you still have  ball left so you continue until that ball is broken  by the time the second ball breaks you should know the answer if not then the strategy is invalidthe question  what is the most efficient strategy for determining said highest floor for this question the most efficient strategy is the one which yields the smallest average number of total drops over all possible highest floors for the buildingexample continued if the building has  floors the strategy described would require x   drops where x  the highest floors number  summing over all possible x we would get  so the average is  drops  note  it is possible that a drop from floor  results in a broken ball  it is also possible that a drop from the top floor results in an unbroken ballan answer will only get a green check if it is both correct and clearly explainedspecial aside  this is my first time posting a puzzle here  i tried to be clear and concise but please let me know about anything i need to clarifyis this question a duplicate  there are certainly similarities between this and the puzzle proposed here dinosaur egg drop  however that puzzle specifies the number of floors and total number of drops  my question asks to generalize the number of floors and does not specify the number of drops only that you can continue as long as at least one glass ball is intact  additionally i do not see the correct answer to this puzzle on that puzzle  some of the answers and reasoning there are definitely similar to what i am looking for but none of those would get the green check from me on this puzzle

28224	i created this variant of a classic puzzle a long time ago before the movie hpcos was releasedenough is enough youve decided its time to take a stand every year since that boy started attending hogwarts dumbledore has given the house cup to gryffindor by a last minute awarding of large numbers of points to him for ever more dubious reasons the gryffindors have even stopped trying knowing that theyll get the cup no matter what happens this year dumbledore has just announced an award of  points to the boy for parting his hair in a most interesting way taking the cup away from your own house of hufflepuff so youve confronted dumbledore and not only your own house but also all the ravenclaws and slytherins have joined you even the gryffindors look embarassed so young hufflepuff ive been partial have i well then lets put this nonsense to rest well have a contest between you and our fine gryffindor champion mr finch bring the urns of peano from my office finch comes back carrying  large urns and dumbledore calls the two of you forward you see that two of the urns are empty while the third is full of balls with numbers printed in a strange magical script indeed you pull one out of the top and try to read the number but it keeps going on around the ball repeatedly yet somehow without ever overlapping itself finally you give up and put it back dumbledore explains in this urn is a ball for every natural number yes infinitely many  a wonderful magic as you can see each of the urns has a dispenser track on the bottom where the lowest ten values in the urn are displayed go ahead take the first ball you pick it up and find the number  when you drop it back in the top of the urn suddenly the balls on the track back up a space while the  ball rolls through them to its original positionthe contest dumbledore explains is this each of your houses are assigned one of the empty urns the two of you will act in turns in each round you young hufflepuff you suspect he doesnt even know your name will take two balls from the track and place them in the hufflepuff urn then our fine gryffindor here will take a single ball from the hufflepuff urn and move it to the gryffindor urn this will continue until one of you can no longer take your turn but wont that take forever asks your opponent indeed it would dumbledore replies but i shall cast zenos accelerator upon you fix a strategy in your mind and when i cast the spell your hands will follow it automatically each round will take but half the time of the round before until an infinite number of rounds have been completed in this way the entirety of the urn may be emptied in only twice as much time as the first round takes your opponents egghead friend can no longer contain herself thats ridiculous the energy it would take is infinite the heat produced would kill us all honestly young lady dumbledore replies you should have learned by now that muggle physics takes a back seat to magic the gryffindor champion still appears confused but sir if in every round two balls are added to hufflepuff and i take one of them to put in gryffindor how will either house pull ahead well just be tied in the endoh no gryffindor you misapprehend if even one ball remains in the hufflepuff urn when the contest ends hufflepuff will be declared the winner let them accuse me of favoritism now your opponent looks very nervous but suddenly appears to listen to something and calm down a glance shows his egghead friend whispering something apparently using a teleloquela charm obviously the fix is in but fortunately it appears that youve paid more attention to your arithmancy classes than dumbledore did for you spot a flaw in his plan you smile as you fix your strategy in mindwhy does dumbledore expect gryffindor to win and what strategy can you use to defeat him

118522	dr bees likes bees  dr bees is not his real name but that is what everybody calls himi should actually say that he is obsessed with bees  bees are his whole life  he knows everything about them  anything anyone has published about bees he knowshe never learned the alphabet past the second letteranyway  he made a fortune locating the best honey you could find anywhere in the world and selling it to people who can afford to pay ridiculous prices for a minuscule jar of honey  he wants to invest his moneyhis latest project is a hotel for bee lovers  he noted that there is no beethemed hotel which he sees as a huge and untapped market opportunity  i mean who doesnt like bees  who wouldnt like to spend a night surrounded by the soft humming of bees  or better who wouldnt like to live like a bee for a night  so he decided that he would build the first hotel for bee lovershe pays a visit to an architect friend and brings along the concept he drafted for his hotel  a large hotel with  rooms in the shape of a beehivethe architect looks at the plan and tries not to laughis it a hotel for  beesno no  this is a hotel for people  but i got my inspiration from an actual beehive  the rooms are hexagonal to minimize the length of the walls  inside i wanted to show people  but i never managed to draw peopledont worry i know you all too well  but i see a problem  real people dont fly  how are they going to go in or out of the hotel roomsi would say with the bees do like the bees  but i see your point  i didnt think of that  can you fix thati think so  first you need an entrance somewhere on the outer wall  then you will have to replace some rooms with hallways  every room must be adjacent to a hallway and the hallways must provide a path from the room to the hotel entrancei see  but that is not good  people pay for the rooms not for the hallways  these hallways are just maintenance and no revenue  how many hallways do i need  i mean what is the absolute minimum number of rooms i need to convert to hallways to make my hotel usable for real peoplehmm  that is a good question  i will have to consult my wife  she is good at these thingsso dear reader how would you solve dr bees problemyou can see a preliminary plan of the hotel  bees represent hotel roomsyou have to replace a number of rooms with hallways in order to provide a path from each room to a single main entrance  this means that the hallways must form a connected region and at least one of them must lie on the perimeter of the hexagonevery remaining room must be adjacent to at least one hallwaythe number of rooms converted to hallways must be minimalso what is the minimum of hallways the hotel needs  show how it can be doneclarificationsome solutions assume the outer rooms dont need an access to a hallway since they can have a door to the outside  while this is arguably what dr bees would prefer it is not what the puzzle asks you to solve  it explicitly says that all rooms must be adjacent to a hallway and the hallways must form a connected regioni will add to the specifications that the outside of the hotel must not be considered a giant hallwaythis is my own creation  i have a solution i am curious to see if you can find a better one

70028	the ubiquitous qwerty keyboard layout works well enough for tenfinger touch typing though dvorak proponents may disagreebut what if youre typing a text message on a mobile phone those fiddly little nontactile touchscreen keys are impossible to touchtype on so i have to revert to the onefinger hunt and peck method which is slow  i wonder if an alternative keyboard layout would make things easierso my challenge here is to design a keyboard layout twodimensional arrangement of the  letters of the english alphabet that maximizes the frequency for which adjacent letters in english words are on adjacent keys of the keyboard  so frequent letter pairs like th or an should be next to each otheri will post at least one of my own answers but will not give myself the checkmarkdefining “adjacent”on a hexagonal grid or a staggered rectangular grid where each key touches six others all six are considered “adjacent”on a straight rectangular grid the four horizontally and verticallyadjacent keys are considered fully adjacent and diagonallyadjacent keys get half credit for being adjacentletterpair frequencythis is calculated from my personal ebook collectionsince “adjacent” is a symmetric operator there is no point in distinguishing for example the th in “the” and “that” and “with” from the ht in “brought” and “daughter”  so im combining their stats here  letters within a pair are arbitrarily listed in alphabetical orderdouble letters eg ll or ee which would have no impact on optimizing the keyboard since you just hit the same key twice in a row are excluded from the calculationall figures are rounded to the nearest  of a percent and letter pairs whose frequency would round down to zero are excluded from this list  thus only  of the  possible letter pairs are representedthe score for a keyboard layout is the sum of the percentages below for letter pairs that are on adjacent keys on your keyboard  but remember that diagonallyadjacent keys on a rectangular grid only get halfcredit for being adjacentplease include your score in your answereh  ht  er  an  ah  dn  fo  es  in  or  en  ou  no  al  ot  de  as  it  em  ar  at  el  is  hs  ev  oy  et  il  hi  am  mo  ir  gn  ae  st  ru  be  ac  iw  ho  di  nt  os  ad  im  ce  co  ow  lo  ai  do  ep  rs  dr  ey  hw  ei  ef  rt  op  su  tu  aw  fi  ch  av  dl  ek  ay  ew  nu  io  go  iv  ns  fr  ab  eg  af  ag  lp  ci  gi  pu  gh  bu  ov  br  ik  my  pr  bo  nr  ps  ap  au  lu  ak  cn  gu  ko  fl  ly  ty  eo  ds  gr  ry  bl  cu  ls  cr  hp  lt  bi  ao  ck  ft  hr  hu  kn  pt  tw  ct  ip  jo  mu  cl  du  mp  ms  rv  bm  cs  gs  mr  sy  by  eu  gy  iu  iy  nw  py  sw  aj  ej  ex  fu  kr  ks  lv  ny  az  ju  qu  bs  ez  gl  iz  lr  dg  dw  fs  hn  ix  kl  ln  rw  dm  fn  fy  gt  hy  tx  ax  bh  bn  bt  cm  cx  cy  dt  dy  eq  gm  hl  hm  ij  iq  jn  lm  lw  mn  mt  nq  nv  ox  oz  px  qr  tz  uz

45569	so about four years ago i was on a trip to elkharak andwhat you never heard of elkharak you never heard of a city where you can find quantum physicist playing chess with cave painters a city where blessed cheesemakers and damned tofupressers wage their eternal turf war a city where soap merchants earn more on the packaging than on the soapwhat about soapboxes wait  you never heard about prophets either yes prophets if you know where to look youll see its chockfull of them each preaching their divinity like theres no tomorrow and for most of them there isnt since almost none of them has any valid claim to divinityalmost nonewhich brings me back to the point  as was i saying four years ago i was on a trip to elkharak when i met a particular prophet that was a bit different than the restyou see i was finishing my red herring when i walked past stalls with woolen fluff into a small circular plaza in the middle of it there stood a young man in fact incredibly young for a preacher surrounded by a thin crowd it looked mostly displeased – but i couldnt tell whether that was a reaction to the prophets words or a horrible rhythmless mess produced by assorted musicians behind himcuriously the prophet himself seemed to enjoy that cacophony and even gesticulated along to the noise from time to timei came closer and i heard  for i have vast and varied powers for i shall shower you with boons for i shall save you from harm for i shall pave your way to victory    you might be of a common profession and you might lack knowledge and skill and the land might be swarming with ones superior to you but believe in me and employers shall fight for your attention and they shall cover you with gold and they shall praise your name to the skies and praise your name alone just dont think your peers will do the same    you might get bald and old and your good health might sail away on the rivers of booze and you might forget how it is to see your feet when looking down but believe in me and you shall have the stamina like you never drank and you shall have the strength like you never ate and you shall soar through the air like you never aged just dont think itll get any better once you actually put the bottle down    your prodigal child might live the life free of care and they might sleep on bags of gold and they might dream of gagtying you and throwing you into a soundproof room behind several locks inside a maze underground beneath a deserted island in the middle of the ocean infested with sharks which are carriers for several flesheating bacteria but believe in me and every time you have a need they shall come to you with tears in their eyes and they shall crack their back for your spare change and they shall proclaim with truth in their heart their undying love to you and there will be no obstacle too steep no sacrifice too high no adversary too innocent for them to save you from harm just dont think theyll come to you by themself on weekends    the sky might be falling on your head and everyone might tell you there is no time and you might feel like you need to be in a great hurry but believe in me and i shall hold the sky and i shall stall the ruthless hands of clocks and you shall have all the time in the world just dont think anything good will happen behind your back    in dangerous times from lands ever far invaders might come into your home murder in their eyes blood on their hands with hate in their hearts but believe in me and believe in me truly and you shall be surrounded by the brightest of my auras and you shall channel the full might of my divinity and it shall cut deep into them    they might have the courage of a thousand men and they might have delved into the dark places of the world and they might have gazed into the unspeakable without a single blink but speak a single whisper and they shall know fear and they shall scatter like roaches beneath your feet     they might have the strength of a thousand lions and they might have torn flesh like paper and they might have lifted the mountains without a single drop of sweat on their brow but place a single touch and they shall know weakness and they will bend like reeds under your hands    and they might have cut down a thousand innocents they might be the very incarnation of ruthlessness and in their souls they might be not a single spark of humanity left but give a single look and their hearts will beat again and they shall finally know peace and they shall know value of all life    believe in me for i can do all of this for my name isand before he could finish out of nowhere came several angry scholars and chased him awaythe cacophony suddenly stopped and the crowd started to disperse i tried to ask bystanders if they knew his name but most of them didnt know it – some in fact were surprised because they were simply looking at the musicians and hadnt seen the prophetthe only person who knew his name refused to tell me and advised me not to pursue him she warned me that in his speech he had spoken about giving his followers the blessings and giving his enemies the curses but in fact he always gave both and always to those who could worship him and before i had a chance to respond she walked away and so did the crowdand thats the story ive been thinking about the prophet ever since dreaming about what i could do with his giftsyoure always a great help when somebodys puzzled so i wanted to ask youcan you figure out the prophets namei know that this might be hard so ill try to jog my memory and give you details that might have been important in the hintsight i mean hindsight hint about the words   while what the prophet said is what the prophet said i feel that a few select phrases might have a subtle double meaning just dont overthink it also  the formatting is for your reading convenience only and carries no special meaning hint about the musicians   the musician were grouped into two bands hint about the scholars   the scholars carried small boxes they were of no particular colour but many were white further hint about the musicians   some of the musicians belonged to a threeperson band there were only two of them present though when asked about that they said that the middle one rarely shows up partly because most critics refuse to recognize him even further hint about the musicians   the remaining musicians were members of a single band they used to work in the textile market but were forced to change careers since they looked as if they could be revolutionaries i asked them if they were antiestablishment but they said no they were the opposite an actual hint thats also the last that also will probably solve the puzzle all by itself   the names of the music bands when combined with their music actually form a pun on the prophets name because of the nature of the prophets name each band of musicians represents something specific and relevant to the prophets name  but that is totally not obvious unless you know about the pun being there in the first place extra hint   to determine the names of the bands you need to look in the theory of literature for one and in the history of england for another extraextra hint   about that double meaning from  on your second reading of the prophets speech you should be aware that not every ailment is caused by an enormous belly  even when you assume it is extraextraextra hint   i have it on a good record that many of these scholars are fond of jam especially the kind thats made of boars deers rabbits and pheasants yet another hint   the bigger bands lucky numbers are  and  as for the smaller band ill rephrase what i said the second person was missingnotreallyahint about an inside joke you probably wont get but if you get it the puzzle will solve itself no seriously its a nonhint if you arent from that community   actually i just remembered that one person from the crowd told me to go to a place where err they play dies i think and ask for uh that one president and something about the beard and he will tell me all about it hm no that cant be rightedit i have numbered the hints for convenience

37462	this puzzle is based on  prisoners names in boxesnames in boxesthe names of  prisoners are placed in  wooden boxes one name to a box and the boxes are lined up on a table in a roomone by one the prisoners are led into the room each may look in at most  boxes but must leave the room exactly as he found it and is permitted no further communication with the othersthe prisoners have a chance to plot their strategy in advance and they are going to need it because unless every single prisoner finds his own name all will subsequently be executedthe night before this game is going to be played also happens to be the princesss birthday during her birthday dinner with her father the king they have the following conversationking happy birthday princess im going to give you  to spend on whatever you want this yearprincess but i dont want money daddy i dont want you to execute the prisonersk now now honey you know i cant do that besides their leader robin hood has already boasted that he has come up with a  of survival strategy though i havent personally figured out what it is yetp silently to herself really ive already figured out that strategyp why not they dont deserve to diek okay i wont just free them all but ill give you a chance to save them ill let you spend birthday money on helping the prisoners outyou dear reader are the princess you have a budget of  you do not know any of the prisoners names or the order they might go in except for robin hood here is what you may buymessage phase send a message to the prisoners this message can be as long as you want within reason allow the prisoners to send a message to you the prisoners know you and trust you and they know you can influence the outcome but they do not know what you are able to do to influence the game specifically messages may be sent in either order but must occur before any of the other game actions this message can also be as long as they want within reasonupdate it is reasonable  by design to assume that they would tell you their numbering scheme for the straightforward solutionupdate it is by design that two way communication is possible but consumes all your money and therefore almost certainly not worth itpreparation phase receive a complete list of all the prisoners names this is here so that you would have the list now but not during the messaging phase after any messages have been sent you may open one box and read the name update you may do this more than once you may swap the names in any two boxes you may choose that their leader robin hood go first otherwise it is random you may name another prisoner that is not robin hood to go first again otherwise it is random completely randomize the boxesgame phasewhen a prisoner enters the room his name will be announced to you before he opens any boxes you will be able to read the name on the paper when the prisoner does during the game you may allow any prisoner to open one extra box update you may buy this multiple times this was originally intended but i didnt realize it wasnt clear after a prisoner has opened a box you may swap it with any other box to provide a different result you must do this immediately upon the prisoner reading the name in the boxupdate i have raised the price of this to a value that doesnt invalidate existing answers correctness but does increase the worstcasescenario cost of pursuing that particular strategy in an attempt to make it worthwhile to possible pursue less expensive strategiesother facts you as the princess place infinite value on the prisoners lives it is of more value to spend all your money to get even just a marginally higher chance of prisoner survival you suspect correctly that the prisoners would not number themselves in a way that is immediately straightforward so that the game could not be rigged against them by the king but they are willing to tell you that numbering scheme in their private messageupdate yes you can assume during game play you may take notes  have a perfect memory youre a perfect logician as are the prisoners isnt everyone in these sorts of puzzlescan you get all the prisoners to survive what is the probability of survivalif it is  what is the most amount of money you can saveif it is not  what is the most amount of money you can save while still having a maximum survival probabilitynote in this question the user talks about introducing a friend but these rules are more interesting and complicated

13303	i never really knew my uncle growing up he seemed nice enough but i got the sense from the distant troubled look in his eyes that there was at least some truth to the rumoursyears before i was born his fishing trawler was lost at sea under mysterious circumstances none of his crew survived and when pressed hed just mutter something about a freak storm what is known is that he spent several weeks adrift and when found he was near death babbling incoherently about pirates treasure and cursesanyway my uncle passed away a few months ago and last week out of the blue a lawyer showed up on my doorstep with a large box that was for some unexplained reason left to me in his will the boxs strange contents included piles of musty leather bound books old tattered maps a small brass telescope a compass that no longer worked it was interesting even a little mysterious but mostly it just seemed like junk however as i flipped through an old book documenting the native flora of some isolated pacific island a small map fell to the groundas you can see below the map is hand drawn and shows the features of an unnamed island in exquisite detailmore interestingly however is the strange riddle scrawled on the back in a delicate spidery script  start your search from dead mans cave and follow the clues herein  sharpen a sword and your wits and youre ready to begin      paired up pared down the truth exposed lies within lies  heading onwards north reeling seas terrorize      right is left and left is right turn and go until  twins appear to mark an end though youll continue still      cardinals sitting in their nests pick them up one by one  set them free and follow them then turn to whats undone      a leap of faith surrender yourself but when things come to a head  take the easy way out with the blues left behind go three and dont retread      follow the gaze of the crimson saint as he looks to the predawn glow  the distance the crow flies in to pi hints how far to go      two one fives all lined up this time point the way  they also indicate how far go now or be led astray      proceed until when viewed from on high the island itself gives a sign  next steps revealed as the river reflects and the ancient stones align      run forth with what you carry confusion becomes clear  now piece together your reward youll find it buried here      be warned though treasure seeker should you make but one wrong turn  the pirates curse and certain death is all that you will earn  its not totally clear but im pretty certain the riddle and map indicate some long forgotten pirates treasure unfortunately ive been unable to decipher any of it and perhaps subconsciously i dont want to find the answer myself for fear of the fate that befell my uncle and his crew either way ive decided im turning it over to you good luck but beware the pirates curseclarificationsto be  cleareverything you need to solve this puzzle beyond a little general knowledge is contained in the map and riddle the rest is just flavor textthe last stanza is also just flavor but the rest contain one or more discrete directionsyou can assume that youre capable of crossing rivers climbing mountains swimming in the ocean etc basically all squares on the map are valid but youll never be directed off the map completelyalso if you want to keep your working to yourself initially this is a race for the treasure after all feel free to just post in the comments the coordinates you arrived at at the end of each stanza with the last being the location of the treasure along with what the treasure actually is eg ab cd  yz  treasure is a pile of gold ill then give a percentage indication of how successful you were obviously when giving an actual answer youll need to justify those steps with valid logic thoughhintsthis puzzle is now solved but ill leave these here for prosperity or for late comers who still want to work through the challengegeneral hints    as realdeo has observed in the comments you cant necessarily assume north is up maybe theres a way to confirm  dont bother looking for a clue that will tell you where dead mans cave is just pick a cave and start it will become apparent as you progress if you made the right choice  almost all the stanzas are effectively standalone riddles so if you get stuck on one you can still work on others though you should still be aware that sometimes things rely on you being in a specific location in order to make sense even then you will likely be able to solve and understand the stanza of the individual stanzasriddles some are wordplay some are mini puzzles some use the map and some are fairly direct though muddied with metaphor  no clue will ever explicitly tell you to travel diagonally or any other nonorthogonal direction though some stanzas will be made up of multiple individual orthogonal steps making the overall movement for the stanza nonorthogonal  dont bother trying to decrypt or decode all the letters around the edge you wont get very far as more than half are just random fillers youll need certain letters at some point but hopefully when the time comes youll know which ones  it will make your life easier if the first thing you do is to determine where north is you can do this before even looking at the riddle  incorporating clues given on rands attempt at finding north paying close attention to the blotches around the compass rose is a captital idea plus im sure the pirates would have put one on all four sides if they could have but for some reason only three have anything visible what could make those blotches and why would only one side not have any also perhaps its worth thinking about whats not there  stanza specific hints     start your search this stanza is mostly just a direct statement so for the moment theres not much to be gained puzzling over it see general hint about dead mans cave above paired up the first line is the most important here as it will help to understand the second paired up to clarify the hint above although the first line is key both lines still need to be used together if the first is the key then the second is the lock paired up you dont need to look at the map for this one just read it very carefully every single word should make sense once you get it paired up the solution to this stanza will be a clear but short sentence with a form similar to head two north paired up people have correctly realised that there is wordplay involved here however beyond some slightly awkward grammar the first line is quite literal in terms of what you need to do right is left where you are on the map matters for this one right is left in response to rps asking if the twins were the ii coordinates  theres multiple possible twins on the map with the correct ones being validated by your movement if you know which way north is and youve solved stanza  you should be able to deducevalidate both dead mans cave  the twins right is left i slightly overstated myself in the hint above apologies though i doubt it sent anyone too far off track you wont be able to  validate the twins and dead mans cave yet but you will be able to narrow it down to two possibilities one of which youll be able to discount later right is left how would a pirate mark and end particularly when were talking about a treasure map right is left obviously ive made the twins a bit subtle so when youre looking for them consider squares as whole units also a pirate would need more than one set of twins to mark a spot cardinals make sure you only free the cardinals that are actually in their nests no others if you get that far whats undone should be clear a leap of faith metaphor and the map a leap of faith where youre standing and which way youre facing matter a lot here if it makes no sense to you youre probably standing in the wrong spot a leap of faith there are multiple individual steps but the instructions are all fairly direct mostly just metaphor with some minor play on words but no tricks like the paired up stanza just make sure those blues are actually left behind when you follow the last step follow the gaze who might the crimson saint be follow the gaze youll need some very basic high school level maths here but currently youve almost certainly got it wrong follow the gaze the distance to go will be an integer value with no rounding or approximating required two one fives two one fives are the key here but there are several other hints in this stanza to push you in the right direction two one fives how could two one fives be interpreted given the pluralisation two one fives although two one fives is the key clue the other sentence fragments are still hints ask yourself why i would phrase the rest of it the way i have proceed until first line is a simple directive the second points to a mini puzzle of its own run forth what are you carrying run forth the first line is your last direction clue the second line is talking about the treasure itself run forth confusion becomes clear can be applied to the first sentence or the second line equally and ive been dropping many hints to various people on how to discover what the treasure is be warned as stated in the clarifications you can completely ignore this stanza  fallen heroesa memorial to those who were lost to the pirates curserealdeo attempted ht

5481	quite a few years ago i cant remember the date but it was obviously some time after i first met ernie at a new years eve party in  i got an unexpected phone call late one afternoon it was ernie he told me that it was his wedding anniversary and he had secretly bought two tickets to see the famous psychic madame mu as a surprise for his wife unfortunately his wife was called out of town on unexpected business wouldnt be able to attend ernie  was in need of company so if i wanted to see the show with him i should turn up at the palais no later than  pm that eveningi arrived in time to meet ernie and we entered the auditorium  the lights dimmed and the curtain rose to show madame mu dressed in a scarlet robe and emerald turban standing centerstage the show was very entertaining a searchlight would raster across the audience before stopping on someone who would be invited to speak with madame mu she would ask them to introduce themselves and then by communing with the spirit world she would reveal various facts about themabout halfway into the show the spotlight landed on ernie who rose and walked down to the stage he introduced himself as an inventor and amateur mathematician and madame mu announced she would attempt something a little special here and would try to channel the great german mathematician carl fredrich gauss the lights dimmed madame mu slumped slightly  seemingly in deep meditation  there was a short pause then she raised her head againgood evening ernest said mugauss in a strong german accent let me entertain you with a little mind reading and lightning calculation the following conversation then took placemugauss if you concatenate the day  month  and year of your birth  digitsin that order you will get a number divisible by  correcternie that is true  but there is a  in  chance it would be truefor any random birthdaymugauss if you concatenate the year month and day of your birthin that order you will get a number divisible by  correcternie correctmugauss if you concatenate the month day and year of your birth in that order you will get a number divisible by correcternie correct  and only about  in  you could getthat right by chancemugauss if you add together those three numbers you just calculated plus your age in whole years you will get a primeernie after a short pause forcalculation youre right again  the calculation works as you saymugauss and by an amazing coincidence the same five facts are also true for your father  correcternie after another pauseamazing  all truemugauss thank you ernest please return to your seat and enjoy the rest of the show but as you go can you confirm your father iscurrently twice your age in yearsernie returning to his seat in whole years yes thats truelater ernie told me exactly how mu did her trickery something to do with internet searches a hidden radio earpiece and an accomplice with a top model clockwork calculator but that isnt the mystery of this story as you probably know by now im great at recollecting conversations but hopeless at remembering numbers i want to send ernie a card on his next birthday i cant remember the date but believe there is sufficient information in this story to calculate not only is date of birth can you help meps  as an added note it may help to know that ernies father is alive and well and nothing out of the ordinary in years of ageaddendum in case it isnt clear according to what ernie told me after the show those three numbers refer to the three numbers divisible by   and  respectively not the three numbers that make up the date

6066	so i was bored and i made a small game for this site in this game the user who solves the previous puzzle gets to create the next one and they will always be more complex website link and string down belowhow it worksyou paste in the current puzzle string in the input box and press reset just to be sure this will setup the game and place invisible mirrors on the board of which there are  typesyou shoot lasers with a click on one of the small boxes on the side of the board the green color tells you where the laser shot came from and blue tells you where it exited if there is only a blue box and no green box then it means that the laser entered and exited in the same boxyou place the mirrors with first clicking on one and then clicking on a square on the board to delete a mirror click on it again or overwrite it with anotherthe  mirrors arevertical and horizontal reflection mirrors worth  point as a example lets take the horizontal mirror if the laser comes from above or below it getsreflected back in the opposite direction if it comes from left or right it passes through the mirror° degree mirrors worth  points i think this is pretty self explanatory as to what happensrotating vertical and horizontal mirrors worth  points these behave the same way as their standard counterparts with the added ability that when they get hit they turn into their opposite so if the laser comes from above at a horizontal rotating mirror it gets bounced back up and the mirror now becomes a vertical one which then again turns into a horizontal one if it gets hit again etc etc the rotation occurs also if the laser passes throughrotating ° degree mirrors worth  points these are the same as the standard ° mirrors with the rotation abilityyour goal in this game is to figure out at which position what mirror is under you got some things to help you with thisthe first is the point counter which shows what the total sum of points of all mirrors on the board so if there is only  avaliable pointsand you are sure that there is one rotating ° mirror somewhere then that only leaves  point left for one basic mirrorthe second is the number of trys this is a counter which tells you how many times you send a laser through from any position since innitializing the boardand the last thing is a counter which tells you how many squares the laser has traveled in the current shotthe reset button resets the board to its initial state this doesnt delete the mirrors you placed on the board but just puts the invisible mirrors back in their starting positionsome additional things to considerthe outer layer of the board cant have mirrors in themyou need to find out the initial state of the board so if there is only one rotating mirror on the board and you hit it once with the laser the correct solution will still be to place the initial position of the rotating mirror on the boardwhen you get the correct solution to the puzzle a message will inform you of your victory and then you will be able to create the next puzzlewhere you will be able to place a total points of mirror worth n where n is the previous puzzles maximum points the first puzzle posted by me will have maximum points so the next will have  then  etc scoring is now different in the new version to create a new puzzle you simply place mirrors on the board when you place exactly n points worth of mirrors you get the next puzzle string when you are creating a new puzzle you will also be able to see the actual laser traveling and if the laser travels over a box multiple times the color will get darkeryou should also probably sort this thread after date to see the latest puzzle the next valid puzzle in the chain will be earliest one with the correct solution to the previous one the last thing i want to impose is the correct format of a valid answer edit check out the current answersversion  use this version for level  to level  httpspreviewciovajurablackboxverindexhtml  version  use this for level  and on in this version mirrors cost more and the difficulty only increments for  point as a bonus the puzzle strings are  times smaller httpspreviewciovajurablackboxverindexhtmllevel  is not yet updated so if you want to solve it use version  if you solve level  in the old version before josh update his puzzle to the new version you are free to create the level  puzzle from this linkjust start placing mirrors the points will update and when you placed a total worth of  the new puzzle string will be shown httpspreviewciovajurablackboxverindexhtmllevel  made by

22550	heres the first riddle i invented for puzzling se hope youll enjoy solving itthis story takes place during world war ii a german spy is assigned the task to sneak overnight into a military base near london and steal secret documents of utmost importancethe documents are kept inside  safes of reinforced unbreakable steel and each safe is protected by a numeric secret code therefore the only way to get the documents is to open each safe with the correct code if the wrong code is entered the safe will immediately trigger a siren which will alert all military personnel so the spy has only one try availablegerman intelligence was able to provide the spy with the following information first it looks like the codes were not chosen at random but instead follow some unknown pattern second they intercepted half of the safes codes which they communicate to the spysafe   code                                                                      the second half of the safes codes is still unknown german intelligence advises the spy to delay the mission until all codes have been discovered however the spy believes that the pattern is obvious as a safes code appears to be the double of the safes numberthat same night the spy enters unseen the military base finds the safes silently opens each one of them with the correct code and steals the documents everything goes well from safe  to however when the spy enters the code  on safe  the safe doesnt open its alarm triggers and the spy is capturedcan you find why if not continue readinga few weeks later the military base has sixty more safes delivered the codes on these safes are programmed following the same patternafter the end of the war the commander of the base is asked by the high command to compile a list of all safes and codes he produces the following documentsafe   code   safe   code   safe   code   safe   code   safe   code   safe   code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      can you find now how the codes were chosen  and hence why the spy failedhint  there is an unique solution for the riddle dont try to find overcomplicated formulas there is more than just mathematics  in fact although there is quite a bit of calculations the mathematics involved are very basic to crack the code youll have to do some lateral thinkinghint  language is important the story takes place in great britain because the riddle is related to the english language the nationality of the spy is irrelevanthint  observe how the british chose the secret algorithm to fool spies code of safe n   times n is a red herring  it looks like it is the solution but is valid only up to safe  with the exception of safe  the units for each ten follow a pattern but each ten breaks the pattern where would you find such a pattern

104484	this is an original riddle i made heavily inspired by the two envelope problem  i have my answer to this problem but full disclosure even i’m not  sure i’ve got it right  i post it half because it seems very interesting to me and half because i want to see if others agree with my reasoning  enjoyjack is invited to a new game show hosted by his favorite game show host monty hall  to start monty welcomes jack and shows him the latest in revolutionary ’s technology a slot machine  but not just any slot machine  when a “betting” envelope containing cash or a check is put in front of this device and the lever is pulled it will analyze it and dispense a “reward” envelope   of the time the reward envelope will contain double the value of whatever was in the betting envelope and the other  of the time it will contain only half the value of whatever was in the betting envelope  truly a marvel of the agesmonty hands jack  in  dollar bills and asks if he wants to take the gamble and play the machine  having studied some basic statistics in preparation of coming here jack is ready to win as much money as possible and runs through some math in his head  he realizes that if he bets  half the time he wins  the other half   this gives him an expected value for each game he plays of          this machine is practically printing moneyjack plays  times winning  games and losing  games giving him   grateful that studying statistics has finally paid off  he’s about to leave when monty announces that jack has won the right to play the bonus game against kirby jack’s hated rival from his high school daysa cart containing  sealed envelopes is brought out  monty explains each envelope contains a check with a value that is a multiple of   the prizes are     and so on doubling each time up to the most valuable envelope containing   jack will chose one of these envelopes at random and let the slot machine analyze itthe game is played as follows  jack will receive whatever is in the original betting envelope while kirby will receive the reward envelope  each of them will be allowed to open their own envelope and see what is inside but not tell the other player  they then have the option to trade for the other person’s envelope  if both players agree to trade the envelopes are swapped  if either of them does not  want to trade then they both just keep the envelope they started withjack picks a random envelope from the  lets the machine analyze it then opens it to find   he remembers how he won money playing this machine earlier and eagerly asks to swap envelopes with kirby since he knows the reward envelope always has a better expected valuemeanwhile kirby opens the reward envelope and finds  kirby reasons that there are only two possibilities either jack has  and the machine doubled it or jack has  and the machine cut it in half  under the rules of this game those two scenarios are equally likely to happen  in other words it’s a  shot for which of those two scenarios has occurred  that means that his expected value for trading is  which is more than the  he has        kirby accepts the trade and both men walk away feeling they had gotten the better of the otherdid either of them make a mistake
47147	a story about a lonely allknowing being  allknowing being kidnapped you and placed you inside its home you  are well fed and have everything you need the thing is you cant  leave and you must play a game of your choice with the being each day  to entertain it for few hours or more    as you were about to ask it politely if you can leave at once it  knew and answered before you even had a chance to speak i see and i  knew that that day wouldve come and will come the day you manage to  beat me at a game will be your last day here then it slowly and  sadly returned to its room as the night was falling    but just before it closed the door you asked silently promise  it replied just a moment before closing the doors i would never lie to a friend  the next morning you wanted to play rock  paper  scissors hoping you can get lucky but the being knew every move that  you will make and had beaten you each and every single time since  its allknowing of course    you had in mind to play a simple tictactoe since you knew you cant  lose at such a simple game but it would always end in a draw since  the being knows how to play each such game perfectly but you were  smart and decided to challenge it to a connect  four since the first  player can always force a win if it plays perfectly and you have all  the time in the world to practice    the second morning the being had already sticked a new fair game  rule on the game board if the game is played in turns a set of  rounds should be played where each player takes a role of both the  first and the second player the true winner is the one who can win as  both the first and the second player this is to ensure that the game  is fair for both players  and so you won as the first player  yes but you needed to also win as  the second player and thus your  plan had failed yet again    now as the third morning came you thought that perhaps it should be a game of pure chance a coin toss but yet again for it to be considered a  fair game if one tosses a coin the other calls the headstails or  the other way around when you tossed the coin it knew the outcome  even before the toss so you were helpless but if it tossed the coin  it also knew exactly how to undetectably force a coin to land on a  side it preferred and no it didnt conisdered this a cheat since  even a powerful slow motion camera could not capture and prove its  dirty trick  you thought that there isnt any hope since it knows everything it  can easily find a way to prevent you from winning even if you found a  game you can easily win every time it could know a way to  undetectably and secretly make you play a wrong move and you wouldnt  even realize you were distracted    and so as one of the many mornings was rising yet again you were  already accepting your destiny to stay here forever but you noticed  the being being sad and worried and then it said i knew this day  had to come of course i did i had to know i know everything    and you stood there confused is this the day i am set free but how  could it be i havent even thought of a specific game to play for  today but suddenly your heart started jumping wildly i know it  how could i have been so blind      being you shouted  i challenge you to a game of  the puzzle question is to come up with the game that had set you free  by the end of that final dayi have a specific solution in mind that is required to solve the puzzle but if you have your own thinking outside of the box solution or a clever way to trick the being that would be interestingnote one of the ways you can think outside of the box    the game you propose doesnt need to be a real life game already existing somewhere you can come up with your own game and as long as the being considers it fair if its fair when played between  random humans there is no reason it shouldnt be fairnotesnote mithrandir had a interesting possibility for a solution but in order to win you cant just win by the rules of the played game you need to beat the being in the game overall that means if multiple wins can be achieved they are merely counted as points thus his solution does not quite fit also do not omit the fact that the being defines the fair game but also dont misunderstand that fact either this note is just to make the puzzle more clearnote philip schiff also had an idea but it does not fit if your game is a set of games and the goal is to lose most games winning a game in the set will not be considered a win problem here is the definition of a win the true win is acquired by satisfying the win condition of the overall game the overall game here is the set of games itself same case as the win as the first player in a connect four as mentioned in the story it does not count since the overall game is being defined as a set of the two or more proposed games to make it fairnote a game is not really a game if you are not playing it thus a pure chance game isnt actually a game you need to have at least some interaction to be considered a playable game and if there is interaction being gets a chance to cheathintssince the puzzle itself caused many confusions and misunderstanding i decided to drop some hints and sleep on it i actually mentioned this somewhere in the comments i think   to beat it you need to use the  things you know about against it   it cant lie to you since you are its friend   it knows everything since it is allknowingmessage to viewersyou people had some nice thinking outside of the box solutions so far and i think i wrongly tried to declare them all not fitting by putting up all sorts of specific constrains you can say i was trying to force you to think of the specific solution that combines the both hints in a single game i shouldve stayed more open minded perhaps anyway a comment on the hints   i guess anything that uses the knowledge and the fact that the being cant cheat by lying thus cant not know something can work perfectly fine against it the real solution is based on that and could actually even be a really interesting game in real life among  or more players

55600	this happened to me in a rental apartment and i had to be creative to solve itthe geniuses who designed the bathroom managed to fit a drawer about a centimeter behind the door and eventually what had to go wrong went wrong the drawer was full of stuff and once we closed the door the drawer reopened a bit  blocking the door from opening more than about a centimeter blocking us from entering the bathroomposition the setup when the door is closed and the drawer is closed normally view from aboveposition this is what happened when the drawer blocked the doorthis only left about a centimeter of leeway for opening the door from outside  not enough to let daylight go through but enough for me to be able to get the drawer to open even more by pushing the door back and forthand because of the form factor of the drawer the front panel being a couple of centimeters larger than the drawer itself i felt the more the drawer would open the more i could open the door to the point that i could actually get a finger inposition using a metal hanger i could manage to open the drawer even more or close it a bit but closing it would make the front panel of the drawer apply pressure to the door eventually bringing me back to position  where i couldnt fit anything in anymore to close the drawer further  i spoke to the locksmith who said he could make a hole in the door in order to close the drawer this would mean id have to replace the door afterwards for a price of about i decided to first test my puzzle solving skills and figure out a significantly cheaper way of closing it  other elements that may or may not be useful the door handle was situated above the drawer too high to touch it or anything the bottom of the door was about half a centimeter above the floor letting daylight go through lifting the door up its hinge was not an option because unless fully opened the frame would block it i lived in a city with all kinds of shops where i could buy all kinds of tools or accessories i lived on a third floor and there were bars to the window of the bathroom meaning no human would be able to get in even with a high enough ladder and the window was closed anyway  could you find a way to open the door without breaking anythingedits i only drew one side of the door frame but it was the same stepshape on both sides as well as on top preventing access to the hinge for example the drawers dont have handles i only put them on the picture for illustration so that people understand they are drawers  taking the drawer out of its rails is not an option because it needs to lift it with both hands also falling on the floor would most likely break it which i wanted to avoid

40136	i present a true story from my past modified only to condense the exchange mildly for sake of a more readable puzzlealexs friends were curious about the modification of their lunchtime routine  why are you visiting him they asked meits alexs birthday cant i visit to celebrate my little brothers birthday i responded as i handed out the last of the small batch of birthday cupcakes i had brought to the second friendyoure not his brother who are you really came a skeptical response from the other friend despite the friends having never met alexs family beforesure i am just ask alex  why couldnt i be his brother  i respondedi got no response to this question  the children clearly still didnt believe me but just as clearly didnt know how to respond to my question  after a few seconds of confused glances the two children appeared to decide it not worth further inquiry and let the matter drop no child should look a giftcupcake in the mouth after alli had spoken no lie during the exchange but i admit i still did feel slightly guilty about the exchange  only slightly though i had a good enough reason for my reply and no harm was done  the three young friends and i enjoyed a pleasant and fondly remembered birthday lunch afterwardscan anyone explain the situation or why the children were skeptical about my answer  whats unusual about this situationif you figure out the rest you may very well be able to guess my good reason but i wouldnt call that a mandatory part of the puzzle the rest hopefully can be explainedin response to a very valid guess but not accurate in this case my parents have never adopted or fostered a child  nor do i have any stepsiblingsediti clearly did not anticipate the number of valid answers to this question i should have taken more time to exclude obvious answers  ive accepted an answer that was close enough having realized with so many other answers that fit the question it was unlikely one would pick mine  however below is the real explanation to the story alex not his real name obviously was a little brother in bigbrothers big sisters of america with me assigned as his big brotheri visited marshal every monday during his lunchrecess hour since i wasonly doing the inschool variant of bbbs which caused his classmates towonder why alex got a special visitor every monday when no one else didhowever alex seemed to prefer not to tell everyone he was in bbbs  thusrather then having them pressure him into explaining my visits isidetracked them with the conversation above we were completely different races clearly not sharing even one parent between us thus the reason the children were rather skeptical of my claim that we were brothers  however they were young children who were only beginning to understand the concept of being politically correct and as such didnt yet know how to bring up the obvious discrepancy choosing to let the matter rest rather then figure out how to touch on the subject of race for my part i felt mildly guilty both for misleading them with my honesty and for exploiting their uncertainty about race  however knowing alex would be far happier if the discussion of bbbs wasnt touched on i figured this was the easiest option and no real harm was done

89433	you have been working on your plutoniumpowered time machine for years and now you finally succeeded      at least you thought you did      after extensive testing with sending back and forth various objects plant seeds and small animals you decide its time for the first human test    all you have to do is let the time machine select a random date in time and transport you then press the reverse button that press will start a complex calculation to determine the exact amount of energy needed to make a similar jump in opposite direction of time once that is done the leap will be initiated    after selecting the random date option you notice something strange sparks start shooting off the panel and the time machine shakes heavily oh no the heavy load caused a minor shortcircuit the heavy shaking causes you to hit your head and you pass out    when you wake up everything seems normal at least as normal as a trip through spacetime can be you are successfully transported to a different time and all you have to do now is press reverse you hold your finger over the button but pull it back the last second in shock you read the travel log screen you havent just been sent to another time youve been sent to fifty other times    in other words after you passed out  parallel copies of you were created and scattered throughout spacetime all in identical copies of the time machine     you calculated before that this could happen and realise that pressing reverse is dangerous it will start the return calculation and potentially send you back however each copy of the time machine processor is linked such that if you and your copies press reverse more than once the additional presses interfere with the calculation initiated by the first press that will send you to some unknown place in spacetime from which you will never be able to return but not pressing the button doesnt seem like a good option as then you will stay where you are and never return home either there is no way of communicating with your other selves    when you take another look at the panel you notice that the battery of the time machine is starting to run out you have to make a decision quick or you will be too late to start the return cycle    you weigh your options if you dont press you will know for sure that you will stay in an unknown time and never return home however if too many of you press the button the return cycle is broken and you will also end up lost in time and space    you are desperate but you know you have to keep your hopes up and rely on your awesome logic skills suddenly you realize something that may be helpful your other selves have the same logic skill as you and they know you do too and they know you know they know you do    is there a way you can make you way home what is the best tactic to maximise your odds and what chance of survival do you or your copies have    to recap    copies of you a trapped in a time machine   all copies including you are equal but independently assess the situation   there is no way of communicating with your other selves   there is a return button but it only works if one person presses it if multiple do it sends all of them to a random place in time   the return button only works for the persons that pressed it   the return button can only be pressed once otherwise the same will happen as if multiple people do you overshoot your return trip   you have perfect logic and so do your copies   no telepathy or anything funky related to the fact that you are copies of yourself the puzzle would work also for  random people with perfect logic   you have access to things you had in your pockets while travelling including your phone with calculator and other common apps you think are necessary no internet though  inspired by a puzzle from vsauce video includes answer to that question so spoiler alert httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnkycwqzbcm

56736	disclaimer this is a scenario that i came up with on my own and i do not actually know if there is a possible solution the reason for posting is to see if the combined intellect of pse can help to find one or refine the puzzle accordingly so that a good solution emerges if this is not in line with pse guidelines i apologise in advance  the puzzle begins below with some flavour text    another day in the puzzling prison another weird scenario by the very intelligent very sadistic and very bored warden having gathered the  prisoners to whom all usual assumptions of intelligence apply once more he describes his latest game      this game is called the minority victory game there will be a series of voting rounds and in each round all voters will take turns to enter a room to cast their vote at the end of every round the vote which was cast less is the winning vote and all prisoners who cast that vote will be exempted from the rest of the game      the game will continue until there are only  or  voters left in which case a voting round cannot be valid my condition to you is this complete the game within  rounds optimal conditions indicate  rounds minimum or all of you will be executed        you are allowed to convene and discuss your strategy before the first voting round begins but after that no communication between you will be permitted let the games begin insert evil laughter here    detailed rules of the game       a vote is cast by a voter choosing between two random and different objects presented to himher in the voting room the same objects are presented to all voters within the same round but different sets of objects are used between rounds the main point is that voters cannot agree before to always vote a in a given scenario  voters do not know how many have voted before themselves with the exception of the very first voter of each round    all voters except the first are allowed to know how the voter immediately before themselves voted    at the end of each round the results will be published to all prisoners not only all voters    in the event of a tie eg  black  white all voters continue in the next voting round and the round counts toward their total    the order in which voters are summoned to the room is completely random and changes between every round    is it possible for the prisoners to prevail yet again or has the warden gone too far this time and created a truly impossible puzzle do any of the rules have to be edited removed in order for the puzzle to have a possible and nontrivial solution  edit  changed rule  to increase limitations but see deusovis excellent answer for a solution with the previous ruleset

7701	one day the warden of a prison is like most wardens in puzzles feeling a little bit capricious and decides that he wants to get rid of his prisoners one way or another he gathers all the prisoners in the yard and explains to them  tonight i will go to each of you hand you a key and tell you who has your key each day after that while the others are out of the cells and no one is watching i will allow each of you to place your key in someone elses cell  and each night you may collect the keys in your own cell if at any point you are certain that everyone has the key to their own cell you may summon me at which point each of you will open your own cell and walk free if anyone has the wrong key everyone will be executed then and there you may discuss your strategy before tonight but afterwards no communication will be allowed regarding my game  oh and by the way if you are still here seven years from today i will execute everyone  itll be a big birthday for me and i want to retirethat night just as promised the warden went to each cell and gave each prisoner a key as he handed each prisoner the key he whispered to them the name of the person possessing the key to their cell the keys were entirely indistinguishable from one another but that was okay because the prisoners had not counted on being able to tell anything about them indeed the prisoners all seemed confidenteach day for the nearly seven years the prisoners all anonymously gave the key in their possession to someone else then hardly a month before the deadline a prisoner shouted to the warden that they were ready all the prisoners were certain that they would live and lo and behold when they put the keys in the locks to their cells every cell openedwhat was their strategy exactly how many days did it takehint   the warden had learned this from his own days as a prisoner when the same challenge was issued to him and just two other prisoners it took only six days of trading keys before they were releasededit oops turns out my prisoners were kind of dumb in their choice of strategy if anyone wants to puzzle out what i was thinking of the information in the post about should be sufficient  but i consider the puzzle and this question to more about the most efficient way to do it the prisoners if wise can be free in less than a fortnight

7819	i have heard of the puzzle with  or  dwarves wearing a hat of a color either red or blue and standing in a straight line and having to guess the color of their own hat  its quite easythe solution to save all dwarves or all dwarves minus the first one is fairly simple and relies on the fact that the number of dwarves is finite so what would happen if you had an infinite number of dwarves standing in a straight line every dwarf wears a hat of color either red or blue and sees the color of the hats of all the dwarves standing in front of him there is explicitly a first dwarf who has to start guessing the color of his hat and then the guessing proceeds with the next one in the lineif a dwarf guessed correctly it is freed if he guessed wrong it is fried every dwarf can hear the voice of all other dwarves without a problem everybody is only allowed to speak out either the color red or blue but no further informationis there a possibility for all dwarves to be freed well probably no but is it at least possible that only finitely many of them are killed edit this is a mathematical puzzle no loopholes
114316	wordle is a game by josh wardle in which you try to guess a letter word in at most six attempts after each guess the letters which are not in the word are highlighted in grey the letters which are in the word but are in the wrong place are highlighted in yellow and the letters which are in the correct spot in the word are highlighted green if a guess contains repeated letters but there is only one instance of that letter in the word the second instance of the letter is marked greyi am wondering what perfect wordle play looks like one can easily gain access to a days answer by digging around the source of the webpage which also allows one to reduce the difficulty of the game significantly by considerations on the games dictionary of solutions because the the site imposes more limited strategies in this way i am interested in the strategy a computer would execute for the general wordle game as defined by the rules listed above i am considering a strategy to be optimal if it minimizes guesses needed to find the answer on average without any knowledge of the word beforehand i am also not necessarily looking for a strategy that is executable by a human rather i would like a series of steps that can be taken by a theoretical perfect player to minimize guessesfor my own play i have found that in a certain scrabble dictionary the most common letters in letter words are s e a o and r i usually guess arose as my first guess although aeros and soare work just as well which seems to give the best chance of finding multiple yellow and green letters if arose is all grey this seems to narrow the possible answers by a considerable amount but if any of the letters are correct it seems that it would not actually that helpful for a perfect player therefore i think that an actual perfect strategy would aim to halve the solution space with every guess but i dont know if this is correct or how i would prove its correctness i am also unsure how i would algorithmically determine the best word for executing this strategy at each stepthere is also the consideration of hard mode a toggle on the website that forces the player to use letters in future guesses which have been confirmed as yellow or green i imagine that a strategy for hard mode would look considerably different from a normal strategy so i would be interested in answers regarding this as well as the normal mode

16055	the following is a probability paradox ive been thinking about  it involves bayes rule  if youre not familiar a good starting example is a urn that has a  chance of containing one black ball and one white ball and a  chance of having two black balls  if you reach in at random and pull out a black ball it becomes more likely there were two black balls to begin with  specifically there is now a  chance of there being black and white balls in the urn and a  chance of there being two black ballsthe setupalice and her husband bob are kidnapped by an eccentric millionaire that performs probability experiments on people  without them seeing the result a coin is to be flipped  if heads one of the two of them at random will be brought to an office with a big red button that if pushed will transfer  to their joint bank account  the other will be left in the holding cellif tails both them them will be brought to separate offices with big red buttons each with which removes  from their joint bank account  they can discuss strategy ahead of time but after the experiment starts they will be kept separate from each other  what should they dothe planalice and bob reason their only two strategies are to push the button or not  not pushing the button is a net zero and pushing the button yields an expected payoff of  cdot    cdot    not being particularly risk averse they decide to go ahead and press the buttonthe paradoxthe experiment starts and alice is summoned to an office with a big red button  she is about to confidently press the button in accordance with their strategy when she suddenly has second thoughts  the fact that she has been brought to an office and not left in the holding cell gives her new information  using standard bayes analysis the probability the coin was heads is now  and the probability the coin was tails is   thus now the expected value of their strategy is  cdot     cdot     suddenly not pushing the button seems like a good strategy  whats going on  what should alice do which analysis was flawed and what is wrong with the flawed analysis  if it matters to your answer assume bob thinks in a very similar way to alice and would likely make the same decision as she would

8076	lets say we are in a magic land with lots of fantastical animals and plants and whateverimagine you have way too much time really like apples and love collecting and growing them in fact there are two rare kinds of apples and their colours are blue and green just by looking at your table you can easily tell that the number of blue apples is not a lot more than the number of green apples lets say less than  timesfrom what youve red in your spellbook  out of  blue apples are poisonous i would take care of that you dont have to just saying anyway you go ahead and add one blue apple which is your favourite kindas a magician did i forget to mention that you now use a very old spell that doubles the number of green apples immediately  next you feel like adding another blue apple right after you cautiously use that old spell again but this time for both kinds at once you are a very audacious person magic soundyou totally underestimated the power of this spell and you can feel that your body cant take such strong magic easily you accidentally drop your wand which is taking action on its own and changes the colour of one apple and also scorches your hat but no problem the hat was kind of maroon anywayleft with two kinds of apples and a burnt hat you divide the bigger group in half now you are ready and decide to eat one of each kindeating soundif done correctly you should have the same number of green and blue apples now im wondering how much money you could get by selling all of themby the way look at all those beautiful colours waittake a few secondshow can this be real  i think the question is given the described operations and the final assertion that there are the same number of green and blue apples how many green apples and blue apples did you start with –  apsillers   ♫ math huh yeah what is it good for absolutely nothing ♫i will also accept the mathematical solution for the sake of emrakul  may god rest his soulnote apples are integers and cutting them is not allowed

40901	on this post two doors with two guards  one lies one tells the truth the most common answer for this riddle is givenhowever while the answer marked as correct is the most common solution i found it does not seem correct to me it as with others in the thread i linked seem to contradict the initial logic of the riddle i have not come across the solution i came up with anywhere so im curious if my logic is wrong or if im just dense both of which are entirely possiblethis is the original riddle in the most common form ive seen identical to op in linked threadyou are a prisoner in a room with  doors and  guards one of the doors will guide you to freedom and behind the other is a hangman  you dont know which is whichone of the guards always tells the truth and the other always lies you dont know which one is the truthteller or the liar eitheryou have to choose and open one of these doors but you can only ask a single question to one of the guardswhat do you ask so you can pick the door to freedomthe most common solution is if i asked what door leads to freedom what door would the other guard point toive seen this solution everywhere but my problems with it are thatit assumes that the guards will point to doors instead of only responding verbally which isnt indicated in the riddleif we ask this of the truthguard he will point to the death door however if we ask the same question of the liarguard he will point to the freedom door otherwise he would be telling the truth about which door his counter part would point to in essence depending on which guard we asked that question they would still point to different doorsmaybe im being super dense here but it seems that doesnt tell us what door to walk through and a better solution would be to walk up to either guard and ask would you walk through this door to freedomwith this question no matter which guard you ask if the answer is yes you choose the door you indicated when asking the question if the guard answers no you choose the opposite doorsorry for the long post but thanks in advance for any responses

40958	this riddle is actually a short story and a pretty hard one to crack ive read it in a book literally more than  years ago but i still remember the important parts as well as the solution the story goes like thismary and max were sitting on a hillside it was a warm summer night and the grasshoppers were chirping slight breeze made it all the more enjoyable to be outside mary and max were talking and laughing carelessly gazing at the beautiful dark sky filled with thousands of starswhat star is the closest to us max asked mary giving him half an applewell thats easy the sun max responded quickly and possibly a bit pretentiouslynope said mary complacentlymax scratched his head and started thinking harder he laid on the ground and focused all his attention to the sky above himwell you do know that the moon is not a star right asked max with a grin on his faceof course not answered mary as if she had anticipated that questionthey kept laying in silence enjoying the beautiful summer skyso which star was actually closest to themnote i read this story so long ago and keep in mind that this version here is paraphrased from my memories which are vague even though my english is pretty decent the same cannot be said for my prosaic style and talent i did spend half an hour writing this so as to best resemble the actual story written by people who write way better than mei truly hope that the way i wrote it will not ruin this beautiful riddle in any waynote slight hint only some people can solve this since there is a particular thing you need to know in order to solve it in addition to being quite good at puzzles as well im only saying this because i couldnt solve it for some reasons that youll understand once the solution is unveiledbe patient for this one i do know the solution
